As we cannot observe them\\n\\ndirectly due to the opacity of the intergalactic medium at z & 5, we study z ∼ 3–5 galaxies as proxies\\n\\nto place observational constraints on cosmic reionization. Using new deep Hubble Space Telescope rest-\\n\\nframe UV F336W and F435W imaging (30-orbit, ∼ 40 arcmin2, ∼ 29–30 mag depth at 5σ), we attempt\\n\\nto identify a sample of Lyman continuum galaxies (LCGs). These are individual sources that emit\\n\\nionizing flux below the Lyman break (< 912 Å). This population would allow us to constrain cosmic\\n\\nreionization parameters such as the number density and escape fraction (fesc) of ionizing sources. We\\n\\ncompile a comprehensive parent sample that does not rely on the Lyman-break technique for redshifts.\\n\\nWe present three new spectroscopic candidates at z ∼ 3.7–4.4, and 32 new photometric candidates.\\n\\nThe high-resolution multi-band HST imaging and new Keck/Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer\\n\\n(LRIS) redshifts make these promising spectroscopic LCG candidates. Using both a traditional and\\n\\nprobabilistic approach, we find the most likely fesc values for the three spectroscopic LCG candidates\\n\\nare > 100%, and therefore not physical. We are unable to confirm the true nature of these sources\\n\\nwith the best available imaging and direct blue Keck/LRIS spectroscopy. More spectra, especially\\n\\nfrom the new class of 30 m telescopes, will be required to build a statistical sample of LCGs to place\\n\\nfirm observational constraints on cosmic reionization.\\n\\nKeywords: High-redshift galaxies (734), Galaxy evolution (594), Lyman-break galaxies (979), Reion-\\n\\nization (1383), Circumgalactic medium (1879), Intergalactic medium (813).\\n\\n1. INTRODUCTION\\n\\nDuring the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), the uni-\\n\\nverse was transformed from almost completely neutral\\n\\nto nearly entirely ionized (e.g., Loeb & Barkana 2001).\\n\\nThis transition was thought to occur at z & 6 (e.g., Fan\\n\\nCorresponding author: Laura J. Prichard\\n\\nlprichard@stsci.edu\\n\\net al. 2006; Pentericci et al. 2011; Mason et al. 2018), but\\n\\nrecent results show that it could have continued inhomo-\\n\\ngeneously in patches down to z & 5 (e.g., observations:\\n\\nBecker et al. 2015; Bosman et al. 2018; Eilers et al. 2018;\\n\\nYang et al. 2020; Kusakabe et al. 2020; theory: Kulka-\\n\\nrni et al. 2019; Keating et al. 2020; Nasir & D’Aloisio\\n\\n2020). The sources responsible for cosmic reionization\\n\\nare not yet known but it is thought that star-forming\\n\\ngalaxies are the main contributors. This is because the\\n\\nar\\nX\\n\\niv\\n:2\\n\\n11\\n0.\\n\\n06\\n94\\n\\n5v\\n3 \\n\\n [\\nas\\n\\ntr\\no-\\n\\nph\\n.G\\n\\nA\\n] \\n\\n 1\\n4 \\n\\nFe\\nb \\n\\n20\\n22\\n\\nhttp://orcid.org/0000-0002-0604-654X\\nhttp://orcid.org/0000-0002-9946-4731\\nhttp://orcid.org/0000-0001-5703-2108\\nhttp://orcid.org/0000-0002-0441-8629\\nhttp://orcid.org/0000-0002-5360-8103\\nhttp://orcid.org/0000-0003-3759-8707\\nhttp://orcid.org/0000-0002-8630-6435\\nhttp://orcid.org/0000-0001-6145-5090\\nhttp://orcid.org/0000-0002-9373-3865\\nhttp://orcid.org/0000-0002-4917-7873\\nhttp://orcid.org/0000-0002-7893-1054\\nhttp://orcid.org/0000-0001-5185-9876\\nmailto: lprichard@stsci.edu\\n\\n\\n2 L. J. Prichard et al.\\n\\nnumber density of quasars has been found not to signif-\\n\\nicantly contribute to the ultraviolet (UV) background\\n\\nbeyond z ∼ 3 (e.g., Hopkins et al. 2007; Jiang et al.\\n\\n2008; Fontanot et al. 2012).\\n\\nAlthough star-forming galaxies remain the most likely\\n\\nsource of ionizing flux during the EoR, the type responsi-\\n\\nble for the bulk of the UV background radiation remains\\n\\nelusive. Many studies of the EoR have focused on abun-\\n\\ndant, young, low-mass, star-forming galaxies as the main\\n\\ncontributors (e.g., Ouchi et al. 2009; Wise & Cen 2009;\\n\\nYajima et al. 2011; Finkelstein et al. 2012; Bouwens et al.\\n\\n2015; Paardekooper et al. 2015; Robertson et al. 2015).\\n\\nHowever, recent modeling found that most of the ioniz-\\n\\ning photon budget (& 80%) could come from massive,\\n\\nUV-bright galaxies with high escape fractions of ion-\\n\\nizing radiation (fesc; Naidu et al. 2020). This theory\\n\\nis bolstered by observations of ultra-luminous Lyman-α\\n\\n(Lyα) emitters during the EoR (z ∼ 6.6; e.g., Hu et al.\\n\\n2016; Matthee et al. 2018; Songaila et al. 2018; Meyer\\n\\net al. 2021; Taylor et al. 2020). These powerful UV-flux\\n\\nemitters are thought to be located at the sites of massive\\n\\nreionization bubbles, which is supported by results from\\n\\nsimulations (e.g., Gronke et al. 2020).\\n\\nGiven the opacity of the intergalactic medium (IGM)\\n\\nat z & 5 to UV radiation, direct observations of the\\n\\nflux that ionized the universe are not possible (e.g., In-\\n\\noue & Iwata 2008; Inoue et al. 2014). However, we re-\\n\\nquire more observational constraints on fesc to under-\\n\\nstand reionization. While we cannot directly observe\\n\\nthe photons that reionized the universe, we can look to\\n\\nz ∼ 3–5 galaxies that serve as close proxies to those\\n\\nduring the EoR. Identifying high-redshift galaxies that\\n\\nemit Lyman continuum (LyC) flux, ionizing UV radia-\\n\\ntion below the Lyman break (< 912 Å), has long been a\\n\\nfocus of observational cosmology. We can calibrate ob-\\n\\nservable properties of galaxies during the EoR, such as\\n\\noptical nebular emission lines, to the LyC flux emission.\\n\\nWe can therefore determine this relation for z ∼ 3–5\\n\\ngalaxies and extrapolate it to z > 6 (e.g., Bassett et al.\\n\\n2019).\\n\\nLow-redshift observations of LyC emitting galaxies\\n\\ncan be used to better understand fesc (e.g., Cardamone\\n\\net al. 2009; Izotov et al. 2016a,b; Alavi et al. 2020). How-\\n\\never, these low-redshift galaxies may not serve as the\\n\\nbest proxies compared to the higher-redshift (z ∼ 3–5)\\n\\nanalogs. For example, LyC emitters in the nearby uni-\\n\\nverse exhibit redder UV slopes (e.g., Borthakur et al.\\n\\n2014; Izotov et al. 2016b). Also, between z ∼ 4 and\\n\\nz ∼ 7 is ∼ 0.8 Gyr, but between z ∼ 0.5 and z ∼ 7 is\\n\\n∼ 8 Gyr.\\n\\nEarly searches for high-redshift LyC emitting galaxies\\n\\nyielded promising candidates that were later ruled out\\n\\ndue to low-redshift contamination (e.g., Steidel et al.\\n\\n2001; Iwata et al. 2009; Siana et al. 2010; Vanzella et al.\\n\\n2010b; Nestor et al. 2011, 2013; Mostardi et al. 2013).\\n\\nHigh-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging\\n\\nis essential for identifying contamination by overlapping\\n\\nforeground sources (e.g., Vanzella et al. 2010a; Siana\\n\\net al. 2015; Mostardi et al. 2015; Vanzella et al. 2016;\\n\\nPahl et al. 2021). Even with HST data, LyC escape can\\n\\nremain undetected from likely high-redshift candidates,\\n\\nbut can be used for upper limits on fesc (e.g., Amoŕın\\n\\net al. 2014; Vasei et al. 2016; Bian & Fan 2020; Meštrić\\n\\net al. 2021).\\n\\nTo date there are relatively few confirmed direct spec-\\n\\ntroscopic detections of genuine leaking LyC flux from\\n\\nhigh-redshift galaxies: Ion2 (Vanzella et al. 2015; de\\n\\nBarros et al. 2016; Vanzella et al. 2016), Q1549-C25\\n\\n(Shapley et al. 2016), Ion3 (Vanzella et al. 2018), Ion1\\n\\n(Vanzella et al. 2012; Ji et al. 2020), and 13 clean detec-\\n\\ntions from the Keck Lyman Continuum Spectroscopic\\n\\nSurvey (KLCS; Steidel et al. 2018; Pahl et al. 2021).\\n\\nA few more promising candidates have been identified\\n\\nwith UV imaging to detect the LyC flux, HST imaging\\n\\nto identify low-redshift contaminants, and spectroscopic\\n\\nredshifts at redder wavelengths (e.g., Bian et al. 2017;\\n\\nRivera-Thorsen et al. 2017, 2019; Fletcher et al. 2019;\\n\\nNakajima et al. 2020; Meštrić et al. 2020; Bassett et al.\\n\\n2022).\\n\\nOne possible explanation for the lack of detections\\n\\nrelative to the extensive LyC search campaigns is the\\n\\nmethods used to select possible candidates. Identify-\\n\\ning high-redshift LyC-emitter candidates requires se-\\n\\ncure redshifts and a method of detecting leaking LyC\\n\\nflux. An efficient way of measuring the redshifts of\\n\\ndistant UV-bright star-forming galaxies is the Lyman-\\n\\nbreak technique (Steidel et al. 1996). This method uses\\n\\nlarge area multi-broadband imaging to efficiently iden-\\n\\ntify high-redshift galaxies, rather than expensive deep\\n\\nspectroscopy of individual sources. An important ques-\\n\\ntion to ask is if LyC flux is added below the Lyman\\n\\nbreak, is the galaxy always identifiable as a Lyman-\\n\\nbreak galaxy (LBG)?\\n\\nThis was the hypothesis that Cooke et al. (2014)\\n\\nexplored by artificially adding LyC flux of various\\n\\nstrengths to LBG spectra and measuring the resulting\\n\\ncolors. Meštrić et al. (2020) also tested this theory by\\n\\nsearching in new CFHT Large Area U -band Deep Sur-\\n\\nvey (CLAUDS; Sawicki et al. 2019) images for LyC flux\\n\\nfor galaxies with publicly available spectroscopic red-\\n\\nshifts. This search resulted in two new candidates. As\\n\\nfound by Cooke et al. (2014); Meštrić et al. (2020), these\\n\\n“Lyman continuum galaxies” (LCGs) are typically out-\\n\\nside of the LBG color-color selection boxes. A fraction of\\n\\n\\n\\nLCG Candidates in COSMOS 3\\n\\nLBGs with LyC flux still reside in the traditional LBG\\n\\nselection region (see Cooke et al. 2014). However, their\\n\\nlocation is inconsistent with the model predictions for\\n\\ntheir redshift. All galaxies that have LyC flux are in-\\n\\ncluded in the LCG definition. However, understanding\\n\\nthose outside of the LBG selection region, that may be\\n\\nmissed by other searches, is a primary goal of this work.\\n\\nEven spectroscopic redshifts in the literature can have\\n\\nselection biases that favor LBGs. Targets for spectro-\\n\\nscopic surveys are usually pre-selected to have a rep-\\n\\nresentative distribution using either color selection or\\n\\nphotometric redshifts. Galaxies are likely to have the\\n\\nsecurest photometric redshifts if they exhibit a clean\\n\\nLyman break. Therefore, spectroscopic redshift selected\\n\\nsamples can also be biased against strong LyC detection.\\n\\nIn this work, we present new deep HST imaging of the\\n\\nCosmic Evolution Survey field (COSMOS; Scoville et al.\\n\\n2007) to investigate LCGs. We use accurate photomet-\\n\\nric redshifts from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Sur-\\n\\nvey (ZFOURGE; Straatman et al. 2016), and 18 other\\n\\npublic photometric and spectroscopic redshift catalogs,\\n\\nto identify candidates. ZFOURGE uses 30-band pho-\\n\\ntometry in the COSMOS field from 0.5–8 µm, including\\n\\nmedium infrared (IR) bands that sample the Balmer\\n\\nbreak at 1 . z . 4. This enables accurate photometric\\n\\nredshifts without relying on the Lyman break that may\\n\\nbe less prominent due to escaping LyC. We attempted\\n\\nto spectroscopically follow up our LCG candidates us-\\n\\ning Keck/Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS)\\n\\nand other telescopes. We present our results from the\\n\\nphotometric and spectroscopic candidate searches here.\\n\\nWe describe the HST observations, custom reduction,\\n\\nand photometry in Section 2. We outline the redshift\\n\\ncatalogs and selection methods used to identify LCG\\n\\ncandidates in Section 3. We detail our various spec-\\n\\ntroscopic follow-up campaigns and reduction in Section\\n\\n4. The sample refinement, properties, and analysis are\\n\\ndescribed in Section 5. We discuss these results in the\\n\\ncontext of the literature in Section 6. We summarize\\n\\nthe paper and give our main conclusions in Section 7.\\n\\nThroughout this paper we use AB magnitudes (mAB;\\n\\nOke & Gunn 1983) and assume the latest Planck cos-\\n\\nmological parameters (H0 = 67.4 kms−1Mpc−1, Ωm =\\n\\n0.315; Planck Collaboration et al. 2020).\\n\\n2. HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE DATA\\n\\n2.1. Observations\\n\\nHigh-resolution HST data are required for this work to\\n\\nidentify any potential low-redshift contaminants along\\n\\nthe line of sight.

Photometric bands used in this work shown\\nover a 3-pixel boxcar-smoothed LBG composite spectrum\\n(stack of ∼ 200 spectra with similar Lyα strength) from\\nShapley et al. (2003). The LBG spectrum is redshifted\\nto z = 3.087 (F336W zlim; gray) and z = 4.391\\n(F435W zlim; black). Four HST bands are shown (left to\\nright): new WFC3/F336W (purple), new ACS/F435W (light\\nblue), CANDELS-ACS/F606W (light green), COSMOS-\\nACS/F814W (gold), and three HSC bands (left to right): g\\n(dark blue), r (dark green), i (orange). Key spectral features\\nare highlighted on the black (z = 4.391) spectrum with blue\\nvertical lines: Lyman break at rest ∼ 912 Å (dashed), Lyα\\nat rest ∼ 1216 Å (dot-dashed), non-ionizing UV continuum\\nrest ∼ 1500 Å (dotted).\\n\\n15. The data were taken using two filters in parallel:\\n\\nF336W on Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3)/UVIS and\\n\\nF435W on Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)/WFC.\\n\\nFor galaxies at z = 3–5, LyC flux (< 912 Å) is cleanly\\n\\nsampled in the WFC3/F336W band at z > 3.087 and\\n\\nin the ACS/F435W band at z > 4.391. These lim-\\n\\nits assume a < 0.3% red leak (&8 mag fainter than\\n\\nthe UV continuum) as used in Smith et al. (2018) and\\n\\nwe refer to these limits as zlim. Figure 1 shows an\\n\\nLBG composite (∼ 200 spectra binned by Lyα strength)\\n\\nfrom Shapley et al. (2003).

The second F336W\\n\\npointing (F336W 2) and F435W parallel (F435 2) both\\n\\ninclude the full 15 orbits. The total area of all the\\n\\npointings is ∼ 40 arcmin2 at various depths. Figure\\n\\n2 shows all five HST pointing footprints (two F336W\\n\\nand three F435W), with names and respective orbit\\n\\ndepths, overlaid on the COSMOS-ACS/F814W back-\\n\\nground image cutout (Koekemoer et al. 2007). We also\\n\\nshow the CANDELS-ACS/F606W (Grogin et al. 2011;\\n\\nKoekemoer et al. 2011) footprint (light green) overlaid.\\n\\nWe use full-orbit exposures to reduce the total back-\\n\\nground contribution caused by post-flashing each expo-\\n\\nsure to 12 e− (as recommended in Anderson et al. 2012).\\n\\nThe longer exposures also reduce read noise and max-\\n\\nimize the counts per exposure for faint sources. This\\n\\nenables improved charge transfer efficiency (CTE) cor-\\n\\nrection which is better suited for higher count levels. We\\n\\nuse a five-point dither pattern per visit to sub-sample\\n\\nthe point-spread function (PSF). We employ a larger\\n\\ndither pattern between each visit to remove the chip gap\\n\\nand low-level, large-scale pattern noise (Rafelski et al.\\n\\n2015). The total exposure time of both F336W point-\\n\\nings shown in Figure 2 is ∼ 44000 s. The exposure time\\n\\nof the deepest F435W pointing (F435W 2) is ∼ 40000\\n\\ns, and this exposure time is split by a 1:2 ratio between\\n\\nF435W 1a and F435W 1b respectively. See Table 1 for\\n\\na summary.\\n\\n2.2. HST data reduction\\n\\nGiven the faint nature of potential LCG candidates\\n\\nin the rest-far UV (FUV), having the best quality HST\\n\\nimages is essential. We therefore make several improve-\\n\\nments to the standard Space Telescope Science Insti-\\n\\ntute (STScI) WFC3/UVIS reduction pipeline, to clean\\n\\nand calibrate our images beyond what was previously\\n\\navailable from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes\\n\\n(MAST). We also developed and apply new additional\\n\\ncalibrations to the CTE-corrected single-exposure cali-\\n\\nbrated images (called FLCs). Some of these improve-\\n\\nments have been added to the standard WFC3/UVIS\\n\\nMAST pipeline (detailed in Section 2.2.1), while oth-\\n\\ners are additional calibration improvements (outlined in\\n\\nSection 2.2.2). We provide further information and plots\\n\\n(Figure A1) to demonstrate our improvements in Ap-\\n\\npendix A.\\n\\n2.2.1. HST/WFC3 darks pipeline improvements\\n\\nThe standard darks pipeline for WFC3/UVIS on HST\\n\\nleft some residual systematic and instrumental effects.\\n\\nPreviously, Rafelski et al. (2015) identified the cause and\\n\\ncorrected for some of the worst of these residual effects\\n\\nin the WFC3/UVIS darks. In this work, we adapt the\\n\\nSTScI WFC3/UVIS darks Python pipeline (copied April\\n\\n19, 2019; Bourque & Baggett 2016). The improvements\\n\\ninclude those outlined in Rafelski et al. (2015) that were\\n\\npreviously implemented in custom IDL routines, and we\\n\\nadd further new improved calibrations. Here we briefly\\n\\noutline the major changes we make to the WFC3/UVIS\\n\\ndarks pipeline which have since been adopted by the\\n\\nWFC3 team as standard for their delivered data prod-\\n\\nucts (released May 2021). The WFC3/UVIS MAST\\n\\ndata also include the new time-dependent photometry\\n\\nflux calibrations that are essential for accurate photom-\\n\\netry (Bohlin et al. 2020; Bajaj et al. 2020; Calamida\\n\\net al. 2021).\\n\\n• A new charge transfer efficiency (CTE) correction\\n\\n(calwf3 v3.6.0; Anderson 2020; Anderson et al.\\n\\n2021) is used. The new code uses a pixel-based algo-\\n\\nrithm that optimizes parameters for the data to mit-\\n\\nigate read noise. This reduces background noise and\\n\\nimproves the correction of bright sources such as cos-\\n\\nmic rays which reduces residual gradients across the\\n\\nimages.\\n\\n• The detectors are periodically heated in an anneal to\\n\\nreduce hot pixels. The period between each heating\\n\\nis referred to as an “anneal cycle”, within which the\\n\\ndetector has a different “fingerprint”. Darks are now\\n\\nprocessed within concurrent anneal cycles (i.e., not us-\\n\\ning the darks from the previous anneal cycle for pixel\\n\\nreplacement). This results in cleaner corrections to\\n\\nthe data, and reduced blotchy patterns and noise (see\\n\\nalso appendix in Rafelski et al. 2015).\\n\\n2.2.2. Additional calibrations\\n\\nThe improvements described so far have been folded\\n\\ninto the official WFC3/UVIS pipeline coupled with the\\n\\nnew time-dependent photometry. We therefore down-\\n\\nload the WFC3/F336W data presented in this paper\\n\\nfrom MAST (on May 28, 2021) as a starting point.\\n\\nWe then apply additional corrections described below to\\n\\nthese data to further improve their calibration. We make\\n\\nno changes to the ACS reduction pipeline, so the F435W\\n\\nFLCs are those from MAST. A Jupyter notebook of the\\n\\nadditional calibrations and some steps required to eas-\\n\\nily apply them to WFC3 and ACS (if relevant) FLCs\\n\\nis available on GitHub1. We briefly summarize these\\n\\ncorrections below and give more details in Appendix A.\\n\\n• We developed a novel hot pixel flagging routine to\\n\\napply a variable flagging threshold as a function of\\n\\n1 https://github.com/lprichard/HST FLC corrections including\\ncodes from https://github.com/bsunnquist/uvis-skydarks\\n\\nhttps://github.com/lprichard/HST_FLC_corrections\\nhttps://github.com/bsunnquist/uvis-skydarks\\n\\n\\n6 L. J. Prichard et al.\\n\\ndistance from the “readout” amplifier. The method\\n\\nused in the MAST data uses a constant threshold.\\n\\nDue to the imperfect CTE correction, this results in\\n\\n∼ 30% of hot pixels being missed further from the\\n\\nreadout.\\n\\n• We flag the negative divots adjacent to readout cosmic\\n\\nrays (ROCRs) in the data quality (DQ) arrays of each\\n\\nFLC. These ROCRs land on the array while it is being\\n\\nread out and are overcorrected by the CTE code.\\n\\n• We equalize the overall signal levels in the four differ-\\n\\nent amplifier regions (quadrants) of each FLC. This\\n\\nproduces smoother images without the background\\n\\ndiscontinuities.\\n\\n2.3. Image drizzling\\n\\n2.3.1. Ancillary data\\n\\nWe collate publicly available ancillary HST imaging\\n\\nto aid with source detection and for escape fraction es-\\n\\ntimates. At z & 3.1 (zlim for F336W), the non-ionizing\\n\\nUV continuum around rest ∼ 1500 Å is partially cov-\\n\\nered by F606W. For z & 4.4 (zlim for F435W), the UV\\n\\ncontinuum lands in F814W. See Figure 1 for the posi-\\n\\ntions of the bands on spectra shifted to both zlim values.\\n\\nWe therefore use the CANDELS-ACS/F606W (Grogin\\n\\net al. 2011; Koekemoer et al. 2011)2 and COSMOS-\\n\\nACS/F814W (Koekemoer et al. 2007)3 images in our\\n\\nsearch and analysis of LCGs. See Figure 2 for the\\n\\nF606W footprint (light green) and the F814W band\\n\\n(background image). The COSMOS-F814W image\\n\\nspans the entire COSMOS field (∼ 1.4 deg × 1.4 deg),\\n\\nand thus we have F814W spanning our new HST images.\\n\\nWe combine the F814W tiles spanning the new HST\\n\\npointings and ZFOURGE footprint with the Montage\\n\\nv6.0 software4. We then reconstruct the header World\\n\\nCoordinate System (WCS) information of the result-\\n\\ning mosaic with the tweakreg routine from the Driz-\\n\\nzlePac package (Gonzaga et al. 2012; Hoffmann et al.\\n\\n2021). This step makes the WCS compatible for use\\n\\nwith astrodrizzle that is used for combining the new\\n\\nHST images. The F606W and F814W mosaics are\\n\\ncropped down to the area of interest covering the new\\n\\nHST pointings, shown in Figure 2. Both the F606W and\\n\\nF814W images have 0.03′′ pixel scales and are aligned\\n\\nto the COSMOS survey coordinates. The CANDELS-\\n\\nF606W images have an exposure time of 3300s and\\n\\ndepth of 28.5 mag at 5σ (Grogin et al. 2011; Koeke-\\n\\nmoer et al. 2011). The COSMOS-F814W images have\\n\\n2 https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/candels/\\n3 https://www.stsci.edu/∼koekemoe/cosmos/current/\\n4 http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/\\n\\nan exposure time of 2028s with a 27.2 mag point-source\\n\\ndepth at 5σ (Koekemoer et al. 2007). See Table 1 for a\\n\\nsummary of image depths.\\n\\n2.3.2. Creating mosaics\\n\\nThe new F336W and F435W FLCs are drizzled into\\n\\ntwo separate images using tools from DrizzlePac\\n\\n(v3.1.6 for F435W, v3.2.1 for F336W; Gonzaga et al.\\n\\n2012; Hoffmann et al. 2021). The updatewcs (with\\n\\nuse db=False), tweakreg, and tweakback packages\\n\\nare used for image alignment. We developed a tool that\\n\\nwe use for cleaning image edges to improve alignment\\n\\nwith tweakreg (cleanedges5). The new F336W and\\n\\nF435W FLCs are drizzled onto the COSMOS coordi-\\n\\nnates using the F814W band as a reference image for\\n\\nthe same footprint. We create both an exposure time\\n\\nmap (‘EXP’) and inverse variance weight map (‘IVM’)\\n\\nfor each of the new filter drizzles. The final F336W and\\n\\nF435W mosaics have 0.03′′ pixel scales and are aligned\\n\\nwith pixel orientation north. See Table 2 for a summary\\n\\nof the final drizzle parameters.\\n\\nWe measure the depth of the images by taking the\\n\\nsigma-clipped median root-mean-squared (RMS) of 1000\\n\\napertures placed on sky (avoiding sources) in the HST\\n\\npointings with our hst sky rms code6. We then mea-\\n\\nsure the flux required for a 5σ detection (relative to\\n\\nour median sky RMS) in a 0.2′′ radius aperture and\\n\\nconvert this to a magnitude for each filter with time-\\n\\ndependent zeropoints from STScI7. The resulting RMS\\n\\nimage depths of F336W 1 (15 orbits, misaligned PAs)\\n\\nis mAB = 29.77 at 5σ and for F336W 2 (15 orbits) is\\n\\nmAB = 30.11 at 5σ. The RMS magnitude depths for\\n\\nthe three F435W pointings with varying orbit depths\\n\\nare mAB = 28.52 at 5σ for F435W 1a (5 orbits), mAB =\\n\\n29.11 at 5σ for F435W 1b (10 orbits), and mAB = 29.78\\n\\nat 5σ for F435W 2 (15 orbits). See Table 1 for a sum-\\nmary of image properties. All our F336W and F435W\\n\\ndata products are available as a High Level Science\\n\\nProduct at MAST via 10.17909/t9-pe8e-s9808.\\n\\n2.4.

Fortunately, new tools\\n\\ndeveloped at STScI allow us to accurately model the\\n\\nPSFs in the UV. We use psf tools, a module in the\\n\\nwfc3 photometry package9 that provides an interface\\nfor performing PSF photometry on WFC3 and ACS im-\\n\\nages (adapted for this work) using the PSF models de-\\n\\nveloped by Anderson & King (2000); Anderson (2016).\\n\\nWe briefly summarize the method for obtaining accurate\\n\\nPSFs for all the HST images and PSF-matching them\\n\\nfor analysis.\\n\\nWe use the make model star image tool\\n\\nfrom the psf tools.psfutils module in the\\n\\nwfc3 photometry package to plant empirical PSF\\n\\nmodels into copies of our individual FLCs and drizzle\\n\\nthem together. The resulting image includes a grid of\\n\\n∼ 1000 empirical PSFs that can be stacked like real\\n\\nstars. We stack the PSFs in the images using new PSF\\n\\n9 https://github.com/spacetelescope/wfc3 photometry\\n\\nstacking tools10. We extract each PSF and interpolate\\n\\nthem onto a sub-pixel grid. The PSFs are fitted with\\n\\nMoffat profiles, checked for quality, aligned, and the\\n\\nmedian is taken. We interpolate the sub-pixel sample\\n\\naverage PSF profiles back to the native pixel scale of the\\n\\nimages and determine a full-width-half-max (FWHM)\\n\\nvalue (see Table 1).\\n\\nFor the F336W and F435W images we stack the em-\\n\\npirical PSFs. For F606W and F814W we stack 77 real\\n\\nstars. We create a convolution kernel using a Hanning\\n\\nWindow to translate the PSF of each band to the F814W\\n\\nPSF with the largest FWHM. We convolve all images us-\\n\\ning their respective kernels to obtain PSF-matched im-\\n\\nages. For the new F336W and F435W images, we apply\\n\\ndifferent PSF corrections for each pointing given their\\n\\ndifferent depths and PAs.\\n\\n2.4.2. Isophotal flux measurements\\n\\nTo identify sources in the PSF-matched images and\\n\\nextract their flux, we use tools from the photutils\\n\\nPython package. The benefit of isophotal photometry,\\n\\ni.e., extracting flux for each object within segmenta-\\n\\ntion footprints, is that it cleanly extracts flux for the\\n\\nfaint blue sources that we are targeting. We first cre-\\n\\nate RMS maps from the inverse variance weight maps\\n\\n(IVM) output by astrodrizzle (RMS = 1/\\n√\\n\\n(IVM)).\\n\\nWe then create a noise-equalized (NEQ) image of all\\n\\nour PSF-matched HST bands. To do this, we divide\\n\\nthe PSF-matched images by their RMS maps to create\\n\\nsignal-to-noise (S/N) maps, mask invalid values, and\\n\\nsum them together. We also create negatives of all the\\n\\nimages (× − 1), including the NEQ image, that we use\\n\\nto aid with source detection.\\n\\nWe make two different segmentation maps from the\\n\\nNEQ images using the photutils.detect threshold\\n\\n10 https://github.com/mrevalski/hst wfc3 psf modeling\\n\\nhttps://github.com/spacetelescope/wfc3_photometry\\nhttps://github.com/mrevalski/hst_wfc3_psf_modeling\\n\\n\\n8 L.

We create a\\n\\nclean map with few spurious objects for source detection\\n\\nand flux extraction (i.e., isophotes), using a 2D Gaus-\\n\\nsian kernel with standard deviation of 3 pixels, threshold\\n\\nof 1.8, and 15 connected pixels for detection (npixels).\\n\\nWe test values for our clean segmentation map by find-\\n\\ning the threshold required to find few sources in our\\n\\nnegative images while maximizing flux extraction of the\\n\\nreal sources. We also make a low threshold map (0.8,\\n\\nnpixels=10) with many spurious sources for rigorously\\n\\nmasking objects when measuring a local sky value (sky\\n\\nmasks).\\n\\nWe perform isophotal photometry with photutils by\\n\\nmeasuring flux within the source footprints determined\\n\\nfrom the NEQ image and giving this as a mask to the\\n\\naperture photometry routine. We first determine a\\n\\nlocal sky value in an annulus around each source. We\\n\\nheavily mask sources with our rigorous sky mask and\\n\\ntake a 3σ-clipped median of the “sky” pixels. We mul-\\n\\ntiply this sky value by the isophotal area of the source\\n\\nand subtract it from the source flux.\\n\\nTo calculate the errors on the isophotal fluxes we\\n\\nuse the photutils.calc total error function. To\\n\\naccount for correlated noise that results from driz-\\n\\nzling larger native pixels onto a finer grid, we deter-\\n\\nmine a correlated-noise correction factor (as described\\n\\nin Fruchter & Hook 2002; Hoffmann et al. 2021). The\\n\\nphotutils.calc total error function then takes the\\n\\nimage data, the RMS map multiplied by the correlated\\n\\nnoise factor, and the exposure-time map to determine\\n\\nan error map that includes shot noise. The photu-\\n\\ntils.aperture photometry routine takes the image\\n\\ndata with the local background subtracted, the isophotal\\n\\nextraction footprint, and the total error array to gener-\\n\\nate accurate photometry and errors.\\n\\n2.4.3. LyC contamination calculations\\n\\nWe measure the probability of LyC flux contamination\\n\\nfor the new F336W and F435W bands using a similar\\n\\nmethod to determining the image depths (included in\\n\\nour hst sky rms code11). We make a 3σ segmenta-\\n\\ntion map for each pointing and randomly place 10,000\\n\\napertures onto it. We use an aperture width of 0.4′′\\n\\nwhich is the average size of our LCG candidates (see\\n\\nSection 5.1). If there are 15 source pixels within any\\n\\nrandomly placed aperture (our npixels value for source\\n\\ndetection), it is considered contaminated. Taking a ratio\\n\\nof the clean and contaminated 10,000 randomly placed\\n\\napertures gives us a contamination rate for each point-\\n\\ning.\\n\\n11 https://github.com/lprichard/hst sky rms\\n\\nWe find a 0.025, 0.018, and 0.013 probability of any\\n\\nF435W 1a-, F435W 1b-, F435W 2–selected source (re-\\n\\nspectively) being contaminated. We also find a 0.050\\n\\nand 0.014 contamination rate estimate for F336W 1 and\\n\\nF336W 2 respectively (see Table 1 for a summary). Al-\\n\\nthough both F336W pointings have 15-orbit depths,\\n\\nF336W 1 has misaligned PAs (see Figure 2) so the image\\n\\nedges are shallower and more noisy. Toward the image\\n\\ncenter at full depth, the image properties will be close\\n\\nto that of F336W 2. These are conservative estimates\\n\\nas the source flux, size, and redshift are not considered,\\n\\nonly randomly overlapping sources in the segmentation\\n\\nmap.\\n\\n2.4.4. Ground-based photometry\\n\\nAs seen in Figure 2, not all our HST images are cov-\\n\\nered by CANDELS-F606W that we use in our analy-\\n\\nsis of LCGs. For F435W 2, we require ground-based\\n\\ndata that span the field and a similar wavelength range\\n\\nas F606W for making color-color plots, for illustrative\\n\\npurposes rather than sample selection. We opt to use\\n\\nHSC on the 8.2 m Subaru telescope on Maunakea. HSC\\n\\nDeep+UltraDeep coverage of COSMOS (Public Data\\n\\nRelease 2; Aihara et al. 2019)12 has depths of 28.4 mag in\\n\\ng, 28.0 mag in r, and 27.7 mag in i (bands shown in Fig-\\n\\nure 1). We take the seeing FWHM values from Aihara\\n\\net al. (2019) of 0.61′′ for HSC-r and 0.81′′ for HSC-i and\\n\\ncreate a Gaussian PSF for each band. We then create a\\n\\nconvolution kernel to PSF-match the F435W images to\\n\\nthe HSC-i band.\\n\\nDue to the large size of the ground-based PSFs relative\\n\\nto the HST bands, when convolving the F435W band to\\n\\nthe HSC-i PSF, the flux from the faint sources that we\\n\\nare interested in is lost altogether. We therefore derive\\n\\na correction to convert the F435W isophotal fluxes to\\n\\n1′′-aperture- and HSC-PSF-matched fluxes. We achieve\\n\\nthis by measuring 1′′ aperture fluxes on our F435W im-\\n\\nage convolved to the HSC-i PSF for all sources. We\\n\\nthen plot the HST isophotal fluxes against all the valid\\n\\nPSF- and aperture-matched F435W fluxes and derive\\n\\nthe following relation for converting between the two.\\n\\nFF435W,1′′ap = 0.6FF435W,iso + 0.063 (1)\\n\\nHere FF435W,1′′ap is the F435W flux measured in\\n\\n1′′ apertures from the HSC-i PSF-matched image.\\n\\nFF435W,iso is the measured F435W isophotal flux. We\\n\\napply this correction to the F435W isophotal fluxes\\n\\nto convert them to 1′′-aperture HSC-i PSF-convolved\\n\\nfluxes so they can be directly compared to the ground-\\n\\nbased HSC bands.\\n\\n12 https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/doc/\\n\\nhttps://github.com/lprichard/hst_sky_rms\\nhttps://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/doc/\\n8 L.

We also find a 0.050\\nand 0.014 contamination rate estimate for F336W_1 and\\nF336W_2 respectively (see Table 1 for a summary). Al-\\nthough both F336W pointings have 15-orbit depths,\\nF336W_1 has misaligned PAs (see Figure 2) so the image\\nedges are shallower and more noisy. Toward the image\\ncenter at full depth, the image properties will be close\\nto that of F336W_2. These are conservative estimates\\nas the source flux, size, and redshift are not considered,\\nonly randomly overlapping sources in the segmentation\\nmap.\\n\\n2.4.4. Ground-based photometry\\n\\nAs seen in Figure 2, not all our HST images are cov-\\nered by CANDELS-F606W that we use in our analy-\\nsis of LCGs. For F435W_2, we require ground-based\\ndata that span the field and a similar wavelength range\\nas F606W for making color-color plots, for illustrative\\npurposes rather than sample selection. We opt to use\\nHSC on the 8.2 m Subaru telescope on Maunakea. HSC\\nDeep+UltraDeep coverage of COSMOS (Public Data\\nRelease 2; Aihara et al. 2019)? has depths of 28.4 mag in\\ng, 28.0 mag in r, and 27.7 mag in i (bands shown in Fig-\\nure 1). We take the seeing FWHM values from Aihara\\net al. (2019) of 0.61” for HSC-r and 0.81” for HSC-i and\\ncreate a Gaussian PSF for each band. We then create a\\nconvolution kernel to PSF-match the F435W images to\\nthe HSC-7 band.\\n\\nDue to the large size of the ground-based PSF relative\\nto the HST bands, when convolving the F435W band to\\nthe HSC-i PSF, the flux from the faint sources that we\\nare interested in is lost altogether. We therefore derive\\na correction to convert the F435W isophotal fluxes to\\n1’-aperture- and HSC-PSF-matched fluxes. We achieve\\nthis by measuring 1” aperture fluxes on our F435W im-\\nage convolved to the HSC-2 PSF for all sources. We\\nthen plot the HST isophotal fluxes against all the valid\\nPSF- and aperture-matched F435W fluxes and derive\\nthe following relation for converting between the two.\\n\\nFpa35wii\"ap = 0.6F r435w,iso + 0.063 (1)\\n\\nHere Fragsw,i’ap is the F435W flux measured in\\n1” apertures from the HSC-i PSF-matched image.\\nFp435w,iso is the measured F435W isophotal flux. We\\napply this correction to the F435W isophotal fluxes\\nto convert them to 1/-aperture HSC-2 PSF-convolved\\nfluxes so they can be directly compared to the ground-\\nbased HSC bands.\\n\\n12 https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/doc/\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLCG Candidates in COSMOS 9\\n\\n3. SAMPLE SELECTION\\n\\n3.1. Redshift catalogs\\n\\nTo select LCGs, we require a sample of high-redshift\\n\\ngalaxies not selected with the Lyman-break technique.\\n\\nWe use the ZFOURGE survey (Straatman et al. 2016) as\\n\\nour primary source of redshifts as it comprises 30 bands\\n\\nof imaging, including medium IR FourStar bands (Pers-\\n\\nson et al. 2013) from the 6.5 m Magellan Baade telescope\\n\\nat Las Campanas Observatory. These medium IR bands\\n\\naccurately sample the region around the Balmer break\\n\\nfor well-constrained photometric redshifts (δz ∼ 2%\\n\\nquoted accuracy; Straatman et al. 2016) of 1 < z < 4\\n\\ngalaxies (van Dokkum et al. 2009). ZFOURGE spans\\n\\na roughly 11′ × 11′ (13′ × 13′ with dithering) region of\\n\\nCOSMOS (yellow footprint in Figure 2). As shown in\\n\\nFigure 2, the ZFOURGE footprint does not span the full\\n\\narea of our new HST F435W images (blue footprints),\\n\\nwith around ∼ 1/3 of F435W 1b and F435W 2 outside\\n\\nthe ZFOURGE area.\\n\\nThe ZFOURGE survey is useful in the search for\\n\\nLCGs as these medium bands sample the Balmer break.\\n\\nThis means that we are less dependent on the Lyman\\n\\nbreak, which may be less prominent in these galaxies,\\n\\nfor determining photometric redshifts. Strong emission\\n\\nlines can bias photometric redshift measurements. Nar-\\n\\nrow bands that are sensitive to emission were omitted\\n\\nin the ZFOURGE photometric redshift calculations, the\\n\\nmedium bands are less sensitive to emission and were\\n\\nincluded, but may still bias the results. We therefore\\n\\ndraw from multiple redshift sources where possible for\\n\\nselecting LCG candidates.\\n\\nZFOURGE sources are Ks-band selected in images\\n\\nwith 5σ depths of 26.2–26.5 mag at a typical seeing of\\n\\n∼ 0.4′′. As ZFOURGE galaxies are Ks-band selected,\\n\\nthe candidates must be sufficiently bright in this red\\n\\nband to be detected and we will miss some faint bluer\\n\\nsources. We therefore collate other available redshift\\n\\ninformation in the COSMOS field to construct a more\\n\\ncomplete parent sample. These include photometric red-\\n\\nshifts from the COSMOS2015 catalog (Laigle et al. 2016)\\n\\nand the CANDELS catalog of COSMOS (Nayyeri et al.\\n\\n2017).\\n\\nWe compiled a catalog of available spectroscopic red-\\n\\nshifts in the field from 3D-HST (Brammer et al. 2012;\\n\\nMomcheva et al. 2016), CANDELSz7 (Pentericci et al.\\n\\n2018), DEIMOS 10K (Hasinger et al. 2018), DEIMOS-\\n\\nC3R2 (Masters et al. 2017), IMACS (Trump et al. 2009),\\n\\nFMOS (Kartaltepe et al. 2015), FORS2 (George et al.\\n\\n2011; Comparat et al. 2015), GEEC2 Gemini-S GMOS\\n\\n(Balogh et al. 2014), hCOSMOS (MMT/Hectospec;\\n\\nDamjanov et al. 2018), LEGA-C (VLT/VIMOS; van der\\n\\nWel et al. 2016), MOSDEF (MOSFIRE; Kriek et al.\\n\\n2015), PRIMUS (Magellan/IMACS; Coil et al. 2011;\\n\\nCool et al. 2013), VUDS (VLT/VIMOS; Le Fèvre et al.\\n\\n2015), zCOSMOS and zBRIGHT (VLT/VIMOS; Lilly\\n\\net al. 2009). We note that many targets in spectroscopic\\n\\nsurveys are pre-selected using color selection and photo-\\n\\nmetric redshifts. Many of these are biased towards ob-\\n\\njects with the strongest Lyman breaks. Therefore, many\\n\\nof the publicly available spectroscopic catalogs may be\\n\\nbiased against bright leaking LyC.\\n\\nWe first spatially crop all catalogs down to our region\\n\\nof interest (shown in Figure 2). We then cross-match\\n\\nthe redshift catalogs within 1′′ apertures (0.5′′ search\\n\\nradii). We start by matching everything in COSMOS\\n\\nto ZFOURGE, then add any candidates from COSMOS\\n\\nthat do not overlap. We then cross-match the other cat-\\n\\nalogs, starting with CANDELS, and then the spectro-\\n\\nscopic redshift catalog. The CANDELS catalog contains\\n\\nphotometric redshifts produced by six different authors\\n\\nand methods with the same data. We therefore calculate\\n\\nan average CANDELS photometric redshift (as shown to\\n\\nbe most accurate in e.g., Dahlen et al. 2013; Barro et al.\\n\\n2019) and standard deviation of the available redshifts\\n\\nand use both in our redshift constraints for selecting our\\n\\nsamples.\\n\\nWithin our F336W and F435W footprints there are\\n\\n8311 unique sources at all redshifts (our “All-z Sam-\\n\\nple”). This reference sample splits to 3065 objects in\\n\\nthe F336W footprints and 6430 sources in the F435W\\n\\nfootprints (with overlap). We create a comprehensive\\n\\n“Parent Sample” from the All-z Sample by selecting\\n\\nall objects from the catalogs with a redshift above the\\n\\nLyC zlim for the F336W or F435W filters. We remain\\n\\nas agnostic as possible at the candidate selection phase\\n\\nand include any galaxy in the Parent Sample that has\\n\\nat least one redshift to place it above zlim for F336W\\n\\nor F435W to probe LyC. The CANDELS redshift con-\\n\\nstraint we use for selecting our Parent Sample was our\\n\\ncalculated average minus one standard deviation of the\\n\\nCANDELS photometric redshifts. There are 574 unique\\n\\nobjects in the Parent Sample: 380 objects have at least\\n\\none redshift z > 3.087 and are in the F336W footprints\\n\\nand 242 objects have at least one redshift z > 4.391 and\\n\\nare in the F435W footprints (with overlap).\\n\\n3.2. Visual inspection\\n\\nWe visually inspect all objects in the Parent Sam-\\n\\nple with at least three different investigators examining\\n\\neach. We inspect the sources in all four HST bands de-\\n\\nscribed here, their NEQ and source-detection segmen-\\n\\ntation maps to evaluate if there is any visible LyC flux.\\n\\nIf any of the investigators notes a detection of possible\\n\\n\\n\\n10 L. J. Prichard et al.\\n\\nflux in the filter probing the rest-frame LyC (F336W\\n\\nand/or F435W), they are re-evaluated multiple times.\\n\\nWe remove any obvious erroneous redshifts (large bright\\n\\nlocal galaxies, star spikes, and bright saturated stars)\\n\\nfrom the sample. We end up with a long list of 77\\n\\nunique objects that have varying degrees of confidence\\n\\nboth in their LyC detection (strength, offset, confusion\\n\\nover the source for close objects) and redshift. We rank\\n\\nthese candidates based on their number of visual confir-\\n\\nmations, LyC confidence, and redshift confidence. All\\n\\n77 sources are used as potential candidates for spectro-\\n\\nscopic follow up to remain as agnostic as possible and\\n\\nas a relatively high density on the sky is required for\\n\\nmulti-object slit spectroscopy (MOS).\\n\\n4. SPECTROSCOPIC DATA\\n\\nTo spectroscopically confirm the redshift and true\\n\\nnature of our LCG candidates, we require deep, blue\\n\\nspectroscopy. One of the few telescope and instru-\\n\\nment combinations that satisfy our constraints is the\\n\\nLow-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS; Oke et al.\\n\\n1995; McCarthy et al. 1998; Rockosi et al. 2010) on Keck\\n\\nI. LRIS is a MOS instrument that allows the efficient\\n\\nobservation of targets in the same field. The observ-\\n\\ning site on Maunakea provides enough elevation to re-\\n\\nduce the atmospheric extinction. Thicker atmospheres\\n\\nat lower sites can impede the transmission of blue flux,\\n\\nwhich would require significantly more observing time\\n\\nto achieve our primary science objectives.\\n\\nOur team has been attempting to spectroscopically\\n\\nconfirm LCGs in COSMOS selected independently of\\n\\nthe Lyman-break technique since 2014, with four dedi-\\n\\ncated runs prior to the HST proposal. This work pro-\\n\\nvided the motivation and foundation for the HST pro-\\n\\ngram presented here (PID 15100). We have since been\\n\\nawarded time for four dedicated separate observing runs,\\n\\nincluding three NASA/Keck and one Large Binocular\\n\\nTelescope (LBT), that are part of the HST program. We\\n\\nalso applied for time on two additional related projects\\n\\nin COSMOS with some overlapping targets and sci-\\n\\nence goals to this work. Unfortunately, nearly all this\\n\\ntime has been weathered out. In total, we have been\\n\\nawarded 12 dedicated nights (over 20 calendar nights)\\n\\nthat are part of, or related to, the HST program pre-\\n\\nsented here. In this paper, we present ∼ 1.5 nights\\n\\nof usable Keck/LRIS data taken in moderate observing\\n\\nconditions (see Table 3 for a summary).\\n\\n4.1. Observations\\n\\nWe present Keck/LRIS data of our LCG candidates\\n\\ntaken on 2016 February 9 and 10 (2016A W034LA, PI\\n\\nCooke) and 2020 January 20–22 (2019B N010, PI Rafel-\\n\\nski). We require good seeing (< 1′′), clear skies and dark\\n\\nnights for our observations. To spectroscopically detect\\n\\nthe LyC, we require the objects to have optical magni-\\n\\ntudes of ∼ 24 mag. We then need around a half night\\n\\n(∼ 6 hours) in our optimal conditions to achieve spec-\\n\\ntroscopic detection of LyC flux. This assumes there is\\n\\nno contamination from neighboring sources or LRIS de-\\n\\ntector issues. The conditions for the 2016 run were rel-\\n\\natively poor, spread over two nights, but we were able\\n\\nto obtain some usable exposures for zf 9775. In 2020,\\n\\naround ∼ 80% of the time was usable but with a rel-\\n\\natively poor average seeing of ∼ 1.2′′ (relative to what\\n\\nis possible at Keck). This poorer seeing disperses light\\n\\nover the edges of the LRIS slit and therefore increases\\n\\nthe exposure time required to get sufficient signal-to-\\n\\nnoise.\\n\\nThe LRIS instrument uses pre-cut metal masks with\\n\\nslits to disperse the light of our targets across blue and\\n\\nred spectroscopic arms. We use the 400/3400 grism\\n\\non the blue side and the 400/8500 grating for the red\\n\\nside with the 560 dichroic. We create LRIS masks with\\n\\nthe autoslit software. The slit widths are ∼ 1.2′′ and\\n\\nlonger length slits are preferred to improve background\\n\\nsubtraction. The masks are designed to encompass as\\n\\nmany of our high-priority candidates as possible. We fill\\n\\nany remaining space with lower-priority LCG candidates\\n\\nand fillers that include extreme emission-line galaxies,\\n\\nLyα emitters and LBGs. We then select at least four\\n\\nstars, ideally five to six, placed as near as possible to\\n\\nthe edge of the LRIS masks for acquisition on the sky\\n\\nand mask alignment.\\n\\nThe highest priority objects are placed as close to the\\n\\nnorth of the detector (with PA=0) as possible due to\\n\\namplifier issues with the red side. At the time of obser-\\n\\nvations, both chips could not reliably be read out, leav-\\n\\ning no coverage at redder wavelengths for half the mask.\\n\\nThe best objects are placed in the central third of the\\n\\ndetector when possible (in x and y) to accommodate full\\n\\nwavelength coverage and to minimize instrument distor-\\n\\ntion at the edges. With an optimal distribution on the\\n\\nsky, about ∼ 25 candidates fit on a mask, including ∼ 5\\n\\nhigh-priority targets. However, when factoring in all\\n\\nthe observational constraints, fewer than that are often\\n\\nin the prime detector and dispersion positions. We aim\\n\\nto observe each mask for a total of ∼ 6 hours in 1200 s\\n\\nexposures to reduce data loss in variable weather condi-\\n\\ntions and contamination by cosmic rays. Typically, we\\n\\nobserved just a few hours per mask if at all.\\n\\nThe Keck/LRIS spectra are reduced using the Image\\n\\nReduction and Analysis Facility software (IRAF; Tody\\n\\n1986) following the standard reduction procedure for\\n\\nmulti-slit spectroscopy. We also use twilight flats to aid\\n\\nwith the blue flux calibrations. A 2×2 binning was used\\n\\n\\n\\nLCG Candidates in COSMOS 11\\n\\nTable 3.

Determining redshifts\\n\\nThe Keck/LRIS observations yielded redshifts for\\n\\nthree LCG candidates: zf 9775, zf 11754, and zf 14000.\\n\\nOnly 14 (seven > 3σ in F336W/F435W) galaxies from\\n\\nour long candidate list were successfully observed due to\\n\\nthe weather conditions limiting the number of masks we\\n\\ncould observe and their spatial distribution. We present\\n\\nspectra for three of the > 3σ candidates, but were un-\\n\\nable to get redshifts for the other four observed. A full\\n\\nanalysis of the spectroscopic properties of the candidates\\n\\n(e.g., Lyα profiles) is planned to be presented in a future\\n\\npaper. Sources with confident spectroscopic LRIS red-\\n\\nshifts and non-detections of LyC are the focus of another\\n\\npaper (Meštrić et al. 2021).\\n\\nFigure 3 (continues over three pages) shows 3-pixel\\nboxcar-smoothed LRIS spectra (black) and a composite\\n\\nof ∼ 200 LBGs with similar Lyα strength to the galaxy\\n\\noverlaid (blue; Shapley et al. 2003). The postage stamps\\n\\non the left show the LRIS mask slits (top, 30′′ across)\\n\\nand candidate orientation (bottom, 5′′ across). Below\\n\\neach spectrum we show zoom-ins on some spectroscopic\\n\\nfeatures. We also highlight other spectroscopic features\\n\\nwith shading: the UV continuum red-ward of Lyα (&\\n1216 Å; yellow), the Lyα forest (green), the Lyβ forest\\n\\n(violet), and the LyC (< 912 Å; blue panel).\\n\\nTo determine redshifts for the candidates, we com-\\n\\npare each spectrum to an LBG composite from Shapley\\n\\net al. (2003) and look at the fit to the profile of the\\n\\nUV continuum. We also investigate all the highlighted\\n\\nspectroscopic information available, including the flux\\n\\ndecrement as a result of the Lyα forest, the presence of\\n\\na Lyα emission/absorption feature, and the fit to ∼ 6–12\\n\\nISM absorption features (depending on the wavelength\\n\\ncoverage of the spectrum). We summarize the proper-\\n\\nties of the three spectra shown in Figure 3 and redshifts\\n\\nwe determine from each below.\\n\\n• zf 9775: We show the blue and red halves of the 2016\\n\\nLRIS spectrum. The profile of the LRIS spectrum\\n\\nmatches the LBG composite, with distinctive breaks\\n\\nand well-aligned ∼ 10 common strong UV ISM ab-\\n\\nsorption features, all assessed to determine the red-\\n\\nshift (e.g., see zoom-ins below). This spectrum has\\n\\na confident redshift of z = 4.365 (with δz ∼ 0.003\\n\\nfor all spectra). However, there is some ambiguity\\n\\nover the nature of this detection. The spectrum is\\n\\ndominated by the optically bright component (left),\\n\\nand we are unable to resolve the component emit-\\n\\nting the blue flux (right; see components in Figure\\n\\n4). Therefore, zf 9775 remains a “spectroscopic can-\\ndidate” rather than a confirmed LyC detection.\\n\\n• zf 11754: We show just the red side of the spectrum\\n\\nas the blue side is contaminated by the close bright\\n\\nsource in the upper right of the postage stamp. The\\n\\nred half of the spectrum shows a distinct Lyα line\\n\\n(panel below) and break on either side from the UV\\n\\ncontinuum (yellow) to Lyα forest (green). We are con-\\n\\nfident in the redshift from the red side of the spectrum\\n\\nof z = 4.470 (using ∼ 6 common ISM lines). However,\\n\\ndue to the blue side contamination and the fact that it\\n\\nis so close to the other source, there remains some am-\\n\\nbiguity as to the nature of the LyC detection seen in\\n\\nthe HST F435W images. This contamination could be\\n\\nincreasing the blue flux through the Lyα forest (green)\\n\\nand even red-ward of Lyα. The red side of the spec-\\n\\ntrum also shows some deviation from the composite\\n\\nwhich could be real (i.e., a very young population of\\n\\n\\n\\n12 L. J. Prichard et al.\\n\\nFigure 3. Keck/LRIS spectra (black) for the three Group A spectroscopic LCG candidates (IDs in figure with year of obser-\\nvation, continues over three pages). The spectra are 3-pixel boxcar smoothed and we show zoom-ins of some spectral features\\n(panels below each spectrum). We show the 2D spectra below for reference and point to the trace of the source.

This smaller decre-\\n\\nment, if indeed a physical Lyα forest, could be due to\\n\\nthe source being observed along a cleaner line of sight.\\n\\nThis could be the case if considering the strong LyC\\n\\ndetection which would require a high IGM transmis-\\n\\nsion sight line. There is contamination seen in the 2D\\n\\nspectrum (upper trace) due to slight slit drift through-\\n\\nout the observations, from alignment star catalog in-\\n\\nconsistencies or length of observations. However, the\\n\\nupper trace does not affect the extraction of zf 14000\\n\\ndue to their sufficient separation. The tentative red-\\n\\nshift we determine for this source is z = 3.727, and it\\n\\nremains a spectroscopic candidate rather than confir-\\n\\nmation. We rule out the possibility that this object\\n\\nis a star as its blue temperature is consistent with it\\n\\nbeing a K star, but the spectrum does not support\\n\\nthat. Its spectral energy distribution (SED) is also\\n\\nnot consistent with a late M-type star. Most catalogs\\n\\nlist this source as non-stellar, but they do have a va-\\n\\nriety of redshifts (z = 0.301–3.953, see Table 5). For\\n\\nit to be a K4–M0 star, it needs to be from 30–128 kpc\\n\\naway to be as faint as it is. Only the reddest M dwarf\\n\\nwould be realistic (at ∼ 2–10 kpc) and they are too\\n\\nred for the SED.\\n\\n\\n\\nLCG Candidates in COSMOS 13\\n\\nFigure 3. Continued. Only the red side of the spectrum is shown for zf 11754 due to contamination from a neighboring source\\nin the blue.\\n\\nThree of the LCG candidates have low-quality ancil-\\n\\nlary spectra. Two of the spectra place the candidates\\n\\nabove the redshift limit of their respective bands for LyC\\n\\nto be detected if present (zlim), and one places it below\\n\\nzlim. Two spectra (Figure B1) are from the DEIMOS\\n\\n10K survey and are assigned their lowest-quality redshift\\n\\nflag (DM18 hereafter; Hasinger et al. 2018). The spectra\\n\\nare for zf 14000 (DM18 ID: L677152, zDM18 = 3.779)\\n\\nand zf 11423 (DM18 ID: L658665, zDM18 = 3.655).\\n\\nThere is tentative feature that could add weight to the\\n\\nLRIS redshift for zf 14000, but with low confidence. The\\n\\nspectrum for zf 11423 shows two very tentative features,\\n\\nand conflicts with three photometric redshifts for this\\n\\nsource, so we cannot be confident of its DM18 redshift.\\n\\nThere is a 3D-HST G141 grism spectrum (Brammer\\n\\net al. 2012; Momcheva et al. 2016) for zf 9775 (3D-HST\\n\\nID: 9997, z3DHST = 0.446) in Figure B2. There are no\\n\\nstrong features to provide evidence for either the 3D-\\n\\nHST or LRIS redshift. The 3D-HST value also con-\\n\\nflicts with the closely matching independent redshifts\\n\\nfrom ZFOURGE, COSMOS, average CANDELS, and\\n\\nour confident LRIS redshift (z ∼ 4.2–4.4). We therefore\\n\\ndeem the 3D-HST redshift unreliable. See Appendix B\\n\\nfor more details.\\n\\n5. ANALYSIS\\n\\n5.1. Categorizing the LCG candidates\\n\\nWe refine our LCG candidates and categorize them\\n\\nbased on our confidence in their detection and redshift.\\n\\nWe select only LCG candidates with 3σ flux detections\\n\\nin their LyC probing band (determined from the avail-\\n\\nable redshifts). We then remove candidates with close\\n\\nneighboring sources (within 1.2′′ apertures), and those\\n\\ncontaminated by bright saturated nearby stars. To help\\n\\nrule out the possibility that our candidates are active\\n\\ngalactic nuclei we check the spectra (where available) for\\n\\nAGN FUV emission features. We then cross-match the\\n\\ncandidate list against the public XMM-Newton X-ray\\n\\n(Cappelluti et al. 2009) and Chandra COSMOS legacy\\n\\n(Marchesi et al. 2016) catalogs within 0.5′′ radii and find\\n\\nno matches.\\n\\nThis refinement results in a final sample of 35 sources\\n\\nwith 26 sources in the F336W pointings and 9 in F435W.\\n\\nWith cross-matching and overlap, our final LCG candi-\\n\\n\\n\\n14 L.

We define\\n\\na redshift confidence parameter (zconf) to categorize the\\n\\nLCG candidates, with zconf = 1 being most confident\\n\\nand zconf = 4 being least confident.\\n\\n• zconf = 1 (most confident): Has at least one high-\\n\\nquality spectroscopic redshift and at least two red-\\n\\nshifts total, both above the redshift for F336W or\\n\\nF435W to probe LyC flux (zlim). This only applies\\n\\nto the three Group A candidates with LRIS spectra.\\n\\n• zconf = 2: Has more than two photometric redshifts\\n\\n> zlim OR has one or more redshifts from a reliable\\n\\nsource > zlim. We consider a reliable source a ten-\\n\\ntative public spectroscopic redshift that we have in-\\n\\nspected (i.e., zf 11423 see Section 4.2, and Figure B1),\\n\\nphotometric redshifts from ZFOURGE or the CAN-\\n\\nDELS average minus one standard deviation. This is\\n\\nGroup B, which contains 10 LCG candidates.\\n\\n• zconf = 3: Has one photometric redshift > zlim from\\n\\na less reliable source (i.e., COSMOS2015, that we\\n\\nfound to deviate more from the other available red-\\n\\nshifts) and no other redshifts (i.e., not enough infor-\\n\\nmation to rule the redshift reliable or not). We place\\n\\nthese candidates in Group C.\\n\\n• zconf = 4 (least confident): Has one photomet-\\n\\nric redshift > zlim from a less reliable source (COS-\\n\\nMOS2015) and other conflicting redshifts that place\\n\\nthe source at < zlim.

Color-color plots\\n\\nColor selections are often used to identify high-redshift\\n\\ngalaxies and LBGs (e.g. Steidel et al. 1996). We there-\\n\\nfore plot our LCG candidates on color-color plots with\\n\\nthe available bands to show their colors. However, these\\n\\nfilter combinations are not the normal bands used for\\n\\nhigh-redshift LBG selection, nor are they optimal for it.\\n\\nGiven that we do not select any galaxies based on colors,\\n\\nwe use these purely for illustrative purposes.\\n\\nFigure 7 shows the LCG candidates split by cate-\\n\\ngory: Group A (red stars), Group B (blue circles), and\\n\\nGroup C (dark blue diamonds). We show the Parent\\n\\nSample of all galaxies > zlim (black points) and the\\n\\nAll-z Sample within our HST footprints (gray points).\\n\\nThe evolutionary tracks for four Shapley et al.

We show LBGs with no LyC flux (dotted curves)\\n\\nand increasing LyC flux as observed from Earth (rest\\n\\n< 912 Å) as compared to observed rest ∼ 1500 Å flux\\n\\n(i.e., Robs =1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%; see Cooke et al.\\n\\n2014) that peel the tracks off at different colors from\\n\\nthe top. Note that these tracks are not at derived fesc\\nvalues but observed flux ratios (see Section 5.4 for more\\n\\ndetails). The tracks are marked at increasing redshift\\n\\n(left to right) with ‘+’s at z = 3.5, 4 and 5.\\n\\nWe show the color-color plots for the HST bands\\n\\n(Figure 7 top row) with colors calculated from our\\n\\nisophotal magnitudes. The isophotal magnitudes are\\n\\nextracted within the same footprints on each band\\n\\nfor each respective source (see Figures 4 to 6). The\\n\\nF336Wiso−F606Wiso vs. F606Wiso−F814Wiso plot (top\\n\\nleft) shows all but one of our LCG candidates selected\\n\\nwithin the F336W band. The missing candidate is\\n\\nzf 13676 from Group B (a lower-priority candidate) as\\n\\nit is not covered by F606W. The F435Wiso−F606Wiso\\n\\nvs. F606Wiso−F814Wiso plot (top right) is missing one\\n\\nof the top Group A candidates (zf 11754) as it does not\\n\\nhave F606W coverage. We therefore use our derived\\n\\ncorrection (see Section 2.4.4, Equation 1) to directly\\n\\ncompare our HSC PSF- and aperture-matched F435W\\n\\nfluxes with ground-based HSC bands (bottom plot).\\n\\nThe F435W1′′ap−HSCr 1′′ap vs. HSCr 1′′ap−HSCi 1′′ap\\n\\nshows zf 11754 (red star).

The boxes\\n\\nare comprehensive to span possible LBG regions. How-\\n\\never, they are purely illustrative and should not be used\\n\\nfor the clean selection of LBGs. We start with the\\n\\nboxes for a similar filter combination presented in Alavi\\n\\net al. (2016) (F336W−F435W vs. F435W−F814W).\\n\\nThe box is defined by the location of color-color evolu-\\n\\ntion tracks of star-forming galaxies for these filters (not\\n\\nshown here, see Alavi et al. 2016). The star-forming\\n\\ngalaxy tracks are model predictions from Bruzual &\\n\\nCharlot (2003) synthetic stellar populations with con-\\n\\nstant star formation, 0.2 Z�, 100 Myr ages and color\\n\\nexcesses E(B−V)=[0,0.1,0.2,0.3]. We apply the Madau\\n\\n(1995) cosmic opacity prescription and dust extinction\\n\\nlaw from Calzetti et al. (2000). We translate these\\n\\nmodel-based LBG boxes in color space to our filter com-\\n\\nbinations. We then expand them to encompass the\\n\\nShapley et al.

Escape fraction estimates\\n\\nIn determining fesc, the escape fraction of ionizing\\n\\nUV flux relative to the non-ionizing continuum, many\\n\\nassumptions are required that have significant degen-\\n\\neracies. These include the SED of a galaxy, its star-\\n\\nformation history (SFH), metallicity, and assumed line-\\n\\n\\n\\n20 L. J. Prichard et al.\\n\\nFigure 7. Color-color plots of the LCG candidates. The top row shows the isophotal fluxes for all sources that have the\\nrespective HST bands: F336W−F606W vs. F606W−F814W (top left) and F435W−F606W vs. F606W−F814W (top right).\\nNot all the targets have F606W available (see Figure 2), so we also use ground-based HSC bands (see Figure 1 for a comparison\\nand Section 2.4.4). We show the Group A spectroscopic candidates (red stars): top left plot has zf 9775 (upper point) and\\nzf 14000 (lower point), the bottom plot has zf 11754. We also show the photometric candidates in Group B (blue circles), and\\nGroup C (dark blue diamonds). For reference, we show the Parent Sample at a common redshift to the candidates (black points)\\nand All-z Sample within the same HST footprints (gray points). Overlaid are evolutionary tracks of four LBG composites from\\nShapley et al. (2003) with increasing Lyα strength (red, yellow, green, turquoise) redshifted from z = 2.7 to 5. We show LBGs\\nwith no observed LyC flux (dotted curves) and increasing observed LyC to UV continuum flux ratio (Robs =1%, 2%, 5%, 10%,\\nand 20%) that peel the tracks off at different levels from the top respectively. The tracks are marked at increasing redshift (left\\nto right) with ‘+’s at z = 3.5, 4 and 5. Selection boxes for LBGs at z = 2–4 galaxies (higher-redshift LBGs are off the plot) with\\nthese filter combinations are shown in gray. Most of the LCG candidates, including all the top Group A targets, sit outside of\\nthe illustrative LBG boxes. See Section 5.3.\\n\\n\\n\\nLCG Candidates in COSMOS 21\\n\\nof-sight IGM distribution through which it is observed.\\n\\nThere are often a variety of escape-fraction related pa-\\n\\nrameters quoted in the literature which can further com-\\n\\nplicate the picture.\\n\\nThe simplest observational parameter for measuring\\n\\nLyC emission is the flux ratio of the observed LyC to ob-\\n\\nserved UV continuum (Robs(λ); see Cooke et al. 2014).\\n\\nWe measure Robs = 4%, 3% and 9% for zf 9775, zf 11754\\n\\nand zf 14000 respectively (see Table 4 for a summary).\\n\\nThese values assume the LyC flux to be in F336W (for\\n\\nzf 9775 and zf 14000) or F435W (zf 11754), and the UV\\n\\ncontinuum to be F814W for the redshifts (z ∼ 3.7–4.4)\\n\\nof our sources (see Figure 1). The Robs values vary\\n\\nslightly from the color-color plot approximations (where\\n\\nthey overlap with the tracks) given the different filter\\n\\ncombinations and galaxy properties.\\n\\nThe parameter required to constrain cosmic reioniza-\\n\\ntion is the absolute fesc, or fabsesc . This is the fraction\\n\\nof escaping LyC photons, produced by O and B stars in\\n\\nstar-forming galaxies, that reach the IGM without being\\n\\nabsorbed by the interstellar or circumgalactic medium\\n\\n(CGM; e.g., Wyithe & Cen 2007; Wise & Cen 2009).\\n\\nHowever, direct measurements of this value are not pos-\\n\\nsible due to the severe attenuation of ionizing photons\\n\\nby the IGM. The quantity used to constrain fabsesc from\\n\\nobservations is the relative fesc (f relesc; Steidel et al. 2001),\\n\\nf relesc =\\n(FLyC/F1500)obs\\n(LLyC/L1500)int\\n\\nexp(τLyCIGM). (2)\\n\\nHere (FLyC/F1500)obs is the observed rest-frame LyC to\\n\\nUV flux ratio, (LLyC/L1500)int is the ratio of the in-\\n\\ntrinsic ionizing to non-ionizing luminosity density, and\\n\\nτLyCIGM is the redshift-dependent IGM attenuation along\\n\\nthe line of sight. Both (LLyC/L1500)int and τLyCIGM are\\n\\nhighly model and assumption dependent. This f relesc pa-\\n\\nrameter can be converted to an fabsesc estimate (proposed\\n\\nin Inoue et al. 2005; Siana et al. 2007) using\\n\\nfabsesc = f relesc × 10−0.4(k1500E(B−V )), (3)\\n\\nwhere kλ is the reddening law (Calzetti et al. 2000) and\\n\\nE(B−V ) is the total dust attenuation (see e.g., Meštrić\\n\\net al. 2020, for a summary).\\n\\nWe determine fabsesc for the three Group A candidates\\n\\nusing the equations above as is traditionally done in the\\n\\nliterature. We first determine average IGM transmission\\n\\nof the LyC probing filter using the commonly adopted\\n\\nmodels from Inoue et al. (2014) (TLyC\\nIGM,I14). These mod-\\n\\nels consider only the IGM contributions along the line of\\n\\nsight and do not include attenuation by the CGM. We\\n\\nfind average TLyC\\nIGM,I14 = 0.0118, 0.0261, and 0.0429 for\\n\\nzf 9775, zf 11754, and zf 14000 respectively. The intrin-\\n\\nsic ratio between the luminosity in the LyC band over\\n\\nthe non-ionizing band is measured for the best fitting\\n\\nBinary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASSv2.1;\\n\\nEldridge et al. 2017) model for each candidate. We de-\\n\\ntermine f relesc using Equation 2 and since our best fit-\\n\\nting E(B − V ) = 0, fabsesc = f relesc, so no further cor-\\n\\nrection for dust is applied. With the attenuation val-\\n\\nues from Inoue et al. (2014), we find escape fractions of\\n\\nfabsesc,I14 = 8.75, 3.63, and 5.87 for zf 9775, zf 11754, and\\n\\nzf 14000 respectively.\\n\\nWe then calculate a new average IGM transmission\\n\\nof the LyC probing filter (TLyC\\nIGM) by generating 10,000\\n\\nsight lines that include contributions from both the IGM\\n\\nand CGM (see Appendix C for more details). We find\\n\\naverage TLyC\\nIGM = 0.0015, 0.0141, and 0.0125 for zf 9775,\\n\\nzf 11754, and zf 14000 respectively. Using the same cal-\\n\\nculation as before with these new attenuation estimates,\\n\\nwe find fabsesc = 111.3, 9.8, and 20.23 for zf 9775, zf 11754,\\n\\nand zf 14000 respectively. Note that these are not per-\\n\\ncentages but fractions so are well over 100% (i.e., 980%\\n\\nfor zf 11754) and are not physical given these assump-\\n\\ntions.\\n\\nTo further investigate fesc of the Group A candidates,\\n\\nwe also adopt a statistical approach to generate realis-\\n\\ntic fesc probability distribution functions (PDFs), fPDF\\nesc ,\\n\\nthat account for some of the sources of uncertainty. We\\n\\nuse the probabilistic method described in Bassett et al.\\n\\n(2022) that we outline in more detail in Appendix C.\\n\\nProbabilistic approaches to estimating fesc have also\\n\\nbeen adopted in previous studies (Vasei et al. 2016;\\n\\nVanzella et al. 2016). We show the fesc PDFs for one\\n\\nLCG candidate, zf 11754, in Figure 8 (left panel). The\\n\\nPDFs are scaled by the maximum probability (max(P))\\n\\nassuming the model flux is equal to the observed flux.\\n\\nThe PDFs are shown at each of the 25 BPASS model\\n\\nages and for the best fitting model (zem5 = Z∗ = 1e−5,\\n\\nlog(age) = 6.0) and the weighted average at this fixed\\n\\nmetallicity (red line). We also show the probability-\\n\\nweighted average fesc PDF at each metallicity (Figure 8,\\n\\nmiddle panel). The red line shows the weighted average\\n\\nfor all 275 BPASS metallicities and ages. See Figure C1\\n\\nfor grids of weights for each BPASS model for zf 11754.\\n\\nThe fesc estimates are constrained from 0 to 1, and the\\n\\nmaximum is at 1. These plots show that the most consis-\\n\\ntent fPDF\\nesc for zf 11754 is 100%. The right panel of Fig-\\n\\nure 8 shows a histogram of fluxes (blue) across all 10,000\\n\\nsight lines for the redshift of zf 11754 (z = 4.470) and\\n\\n10,000 fesc values between 0 and 1 (108 trials). The ob-\\n\\nservational data for zf 11754 are represented by a Gaus-\\n\\nsian (black curve) with mean of its observed LyC flux\\n\\nin F435W (µ) and width of the flux error (σ).

The probability that each individual mock observation is consistent with the observed flux is determined by taking\\nthe value at the model flux for a Gaussian distribution (dashed line: observed flux; dotted lines: FWHM flux error).

This is\\n\\nalso the case for the other two spectroscopic candidates\\n\\nzf 9775 and zf 14000, so we only present the plots for\\n\\nzf 11754 to illustrate the method. An additional caveat\\n\\nfor zf 14000 is that from the full array of SEDs, there\\n\\nare no models that fit the data well, whereas the best-\\n\\nfit models to zf 11754 and zf 9775 are realistic. We\\n\\ntherefore have additional doubts about the validity of\\n\\nthe fPDF\\nesc measurement, and therefore LyC detection, of\\n\\nzf 14000.\\n\\n6. DISCUSSION\\n\\n6.1. Escape fraction comparison\\n\\nThe most likely value of fabsesc and fPDF\\nesc for all three\\n\\nGroup A spectroscopic candidates is > 100%, and there-\\n\\nfore not physical with these models and assumptions.\\n\\nIt is possible that some assumptions that go into the\\n\\nfPDF\\nesc calculations may not be appropriate for our can-\\n\\ndidates. Many of the assumptions are those commonly\\n\\nadopted by others for the more traditional fesc estimates\\n\\n(e.g., fabsesc calculated with Equation 3). The models\\n\\n(BPASSv2.1; Eldridge et al. 2017), metallicity ranges\\n\\n(Steidel et al. 2018; Fletcher et al. 2019; Bassett et al.\\n\\n2021a), and IGM sight line calculations (Inoue et al.\\n\\n2014; Steidel et al. 2018; Bassett et al. 2021a) are all\\n\\nbased on established methods but do not include strong\\n\\nemission lines in the SEDs, only exponentially declining\\n\\nSFHs. Although as the best fitting model for all three\\n\\nGroup A candidates is “zero-age” for BPASS (equiva-\\n\\nlent to a single, instantaneous burst with an age of 106\\n\\nyears), the choice of SFH will not affect the fact that\\n\\nfPDF\\nesc is unconstrained at > 100% (see Appendix C),\\n\\nThe statistical fPDF\\nesc estimate approach presented here\\n\\nhas been tested on a spectroscopically confirmed z =\\n\\n3.64 galaxy (VUDS 511227001; Le Fèvre et al. 2015) in\\n\\nBassett et al. (2022). CLAUDS (Sawicki et al. 2019)\\n\\nU -band shows a LyC detection for this galaxy. The re-\\n\\nsulting PDF has a peak within the 0 to 1 range, with\\n\\nfPDF\\nesc = 0.45+0.39\\n\\n−0.28. If we derive many more possible sight\\n\\nlines (107 rather than 104), it is possible that at least one\\n\\nwould be transparent enough to match the observed flux\\n\\nfor our candidates. However, all three would be unlikely\\n\\nto be within our four untargeted HST pointings.\\n\\nfesc is a valuable parameter that is highly uncon-\\n\\nstrained with estimates in the literature ranging from\\n\\n0 to > 100%. The clean sample of 13 KLCS LyC emit-\\n\\nters (Steidel et al. 2018; Pahl et al. 2021) have fabsesc =\\n\\n0.21 ± 0.03, with a full sample estimate (including 107\\n\\nnon-LyC detected z ∼ 3 galaxies) of fabsesc = 0.06± 0.01.\\n\\nIn Meštrić et al. (2020), they present two promising LCG\\n\\ncandidates with spectroscopic redshifts, high-resolution\\n\\noptical HST imaging (to identify contaminants), and\\n\\nCLAUDS U -band LyC detections. Meštrić et al. (2020)\\n\\nestimate fabsesc for these two candidates in the range\\n\\n∼ 5%–73% and ∼ 30%–93%. The spectroscopically con-\\n\\nfirmed LyC emitter, Ion2 at z = 3.2 (Vanzella et al.\\n\\n2015; de Barros et al. 2016; Vanzella et al. 2016), has\\n\\nan fabsesc range of ∼ 50%–100% depending on IGM atten-\\n\\nuation. For the confirmed LyC emitter Q1549-C25 at\\n\\nz = 3.15, Shapley et al. (2016) find fabsesc ≥ 0.51 at 95%\\n\\nconfidence, but that fabsesc ≤ 1 is at a 45% confidence.\\n\\nIon3 at z = 4.0 has a quoted f relesc ∼ 60% (Vanzella\\n\\net al. 2018). An additional five z ∼ 3–3.6 galaxies from\\n\\nLACES have average LyC fabsesc = 0.35±0.14 (Nakajima\\n\\net al. 2020). While a lensed z = 2.5 dwarf galaxy was\\n\\nfound to have fabsesc \\' 28–57% from imaging (Bian et al.\\n\\n2017). The lensed “Sunburst Arc” at z = 2.37 (Rivera-\\n\\nThorsen et al. 2017) has line-of-sight fabsesc = 32+2\\n−4%,\\n\\nalthough the global escape fraction is expected to be\\n\\nmuch lower (Rivera-Thorsen et al. 2019).\\n\\nThis large uncertainty can exist even for individual\\n\\nsources as measured in simulations (e.g., Paardekooper\\n\\net al. 2015; Trebitsch et al. 2017; Rosdahl et al. 2018).\\n\\nThe true form of fPDF\\nesc could also vary by several factors,\\n\\nincluding galaxy mass, which further complicates its ac-\\n\\ncurate estimation (e.g., Finkelstein et al. 2019; Naidu\\n\\net al. 2020; Bassett et al. 2021a). The broad range of\\n\\nfesc estimates in the literature, and even for each indi-\\n\\nvidual source, makes it hard to infer meaningful inter-\\n\\npretations for the ionizing flux contributions from high-\\n\\nredshift galaxies. There only exists a relatively small\\n\\nsample of individually detected LyC candidates and they\\n\\nmake up a diverse population of chance detections.\\n\\nA key conclusion from Meštrić et al. (2020) was that\\n\\nonly the cleanest lines of sight could work for observing\\n\\nLCGs. Therefore, these detections tell us as much about\\n\\nthe random line of sight of the galaxies as it does about\\n\\nthe galaxies themselves. It is likely that a population\\n\\nof high-redshift (z ∼ 3–5) galaxies may hold some of\\n\\nthe most valuable clues about the sources that reionized\\n\\nthe universe due to their proximity in time, and likely\\n\\ntheir physical properties. However, given the severe at-\\n\\ntenuation of LyC photons by the intervening IGM, this\\n\\npopulation remains incredibly elusive.\\n\\nOnly in large statistical numbers can we average over\\n\\npossible IGM sight lines. Even then, many of those that\\n\\nwe observe in the LyC may exist along the cleanest lines\\n\\nof sight. Non-detections of LyC may be the best path\\n\\nforward for constraining the global ionizing photon bud-\\n\\nget. The KLCS clean non-detection (< 3σ) sample of\\n\\n\\n\\n24 L. J. Prichard et al.\\n\\n107 galaxies has a fabsesc = 0.05±0.01 (Steidel et al. 2018;\\n\\nPahl et al. 2021). Bian & Fan (2020) stack 54 Lyα emit-\\n\\nters at z \\' 3.1 and find no visible LyC but 3σ upper lim-\\n\\nits of fabsesc < 14–32%. LBG stacks from Ji et al. (2020)\\n\\ngive upper limits of fabsesc . 0.63%. The spectroscopic as-\\n\\nsessment in Cooke et al. (2014) gives fabsesc upper limits\\n\\nof 0.086 for z ∼ 3 galaxies. Using a simplified stacking\\n\\nmethod of fabsesc for galaxies without AGN at z ∼ 2.3–4.3,\\n\\nSmith et al. (2018, 2020) find limits of 0.08, 0.06, 0.57\\n\\nfor F225W, F275W and F336W respectively from their\\n\\nstacks. Meštrić et al. (2021) analyze quoted upper limits\\n\\nin the literature and find global fabsesc values of 0.086 at\\n\\n2 . z ≤ 3, 0.105 at 3 ≤ z ≤ 4 and 0.084 at 2 . z < 6.\\n\\n6.2. Do the LCG candidates have line-of-sight\\n\\nlow-redshift interlopers?\\n\\nEven with deep HST LyC imaging and secure LRIS\\n\\nredshifts for zf 9775 and zf 11754, the LCGs presented in\\n\\nthis paper remain candidates. This is in part due to the\\n\\nquality of the spectra given consistently poor weather\\n\\nconditions for our observations (see Table 3) and slit po-\\n\\nsitioning on our targets. Nevertheless, from the spectra\\n\\nand imaging alone, these appear to be promising can-\\n\\ndidates. However, the fabsesc values and statistical fPDF\\nesc\\n\\nestimates (that explore a broader range of possible as-\\n\\nsumptions than are usually adopted), we find that the\\n\\nmost likely fesc is > 100% and therefore not physical\\n\\ngiven these models and assumptions.\\n\\nThe candidates shown on the color-color plots (Figure\\n\\n7) mostly sit outside the comprehensive LBG region.\\n\\nThis was hypothesized by Cooke et al. (2014) and found\\n\\nwith a small number of LCG candidates by Meštrić et al.\\n\\n(2020). The Group A candidates sit on the LBG tracks\\n\\nwith observed LyC flux artificially added (Robs ∼ 5%\\n\\nfor zf 9775, Robs ∼ 10% for zf 11754 and zf 14000, see\\n\\nTable 4 for calculated values). This could imply that\\n\\nthese LCGs are similar to LBGs that exhibit LyC flux\\n\\n(as shown in KLCS; Steidel et al. 2018; Pahl et al. 2021)\\n\\nor they have flux contamination.\\n\\nAre the Group A spectroscopic LCG candidates con-\\n\\ntaminated by low-redshift interlopers? Spatially resolv-\\n\\ning the LyC in high-resolution imaging is one of the\\n\\nbest ways to identify low-redshift contaminants (e.g.,\\n\\nVanzella et al. 2012). We find that the chance of contam-\\n\\nination is higher than the LCG candidate detection rates\\n\\nof sources in the field. We derive 1.3% to 5.0% probabil-\\n\\nities of 3σ overlapping sources in our deep HST F336W\\n\\nand F435W images probing the LyC (see Section 2.4.3,\\n\\nTable 1). The redshift-independent contamination rates\\n\\nare higher than the detection rates relative to the All-\\n\\nz Sample from the combined redshift catalog (0.85% in\\n\\nF336W, 0.14% in F435W). Therefore, it is possible that\\n\\nour candidates are high-redshift sources contaminated\\n\\nby low-redshift interlopers and our selection method is\\n\\nbiased towards finding these chance alignments.\\n\\nOur blue HST images (∼ 29–30 mag depths at 5σ) are\\n\\ndeeper than other searches for LyC emitters. Compara-\\n\\nble surveys from Siana et al. (2015) reach ∼ 29.27 mag\\n\\nat 5σ and Smith et al. (2018, 2020) reach ∼ 29.11 mag at\\n\\n5σ in F336W (with data from Oesch et al. 2018). Deeper\\n\\nbluer filter images could help to resolve the question of\\n\\npossible contamination. However, with deeper images,\\n\\npicking up faint foreground sources is more likely (e.g.,\\n\\nAlavi et al. 2014). At the high redshift of our candidates\\n\\n(z ∼ 3.7–4.4) the sight line is long and therefore the\\n\\nchance of coincident sources is higher, compared with\\n\\nz ∼ 1 (e.g., Siana et al. 2007, 2010).\\n\\nHigher signal-to-noise spectra with maximal spatial\\n\\nseparation of components along the slit of zf 9775 might\\n\\nhelp us identify the true nature of the candidate. If de-\\n\\ntected, emission lines in the LyC part of the spectrum\\n\\ncould confirm this double source as a low-redshift inter-\\n\\nloper rather than a physical merger. The LyC emission\\n\\nfor zf 11754 is also slightly offset from the optical emis-\\n\\nsion and could also be contaminated. zf 14000 is very\\n\\ncentered but this is the Group A candidate with the\\n\\nlargest uncertainties with respect to its nature, redshift,\\n\\nand fesc estimates. However, it may be that LyC flux\\n\\ndoes not trace non-ionizing flux, for example mergers\\n\\ncan disrupt gas in galaxies, inhomogeneously exposing\\n\\nstar-forming regions.\\n\\nAt higher redshifts, the IGM opacity increases sig-\\n\\nnificantly. This further reduces the chance of iden-\\n\\ntifying strong LyC detection, particularly at the red-\\n\\nshifts of our Group A spectroscopic candidates (z ∼\\n3.7–4.4). For zf 9775 and zf 14000, the band cleanly\\n\\nsampling their LyC flux is F336W (zf 9775 also has\\n\\nF435W which contains some forest lines), which would\\n\\nbe around ∼ 560–695 Å. The expected LyC flux is low\\n\\nin F336W, e.g., intrinsic: Fint = 0.034 µJy, attenuated:\\n\\nFatt = 5.2e−5±3.2e−4 µJy, ≈ 34.6±6.6 mag. Although,\\n\\nIon3 does show faint LyC down to 750 Å (Vanzella et al.\\n\\n2018). The results presented in this work are a caution-\\n\\nary tale that even with a blue spectroscopic redshift,\\n\\ndetection in a “LyC” probing band, and HST imaging\\n\\nto remove contamination, the true nature of the sources\\n\\nmay still not be clear.\\n\\n6.3. Future prospects & need for spectroscopic\\n\\nfollow-up\\n\\nThe Group A spectroscopic candidates are the three\\n\\nbrightest galaxies of all our LCG candidates, with\\n\\nisophotal mF814W < 25 mag. Given the poor to mod-\\n\\nerate observing conditions (with poorer-than-optimal\\n\\n\\n\\nLCG Candidates in COSMOS 25\\n\\nseeing), obtaining spectra for galaxies fainter than\\n\\nmF814W ∼ 25 proved challenging. Of the three top can-\\n\\ndidates, additional improved spectra are required to con-\\n\\nfirm them as genuine LCGs. A slit orientation to max-\\n\\nimally spatially resolve the two components of zf 9775\\n\\nis needed. A slit for zf 11754 placed to avoid its bright\\n\\nneighboring sources is also required. We have already at-\\n\\ntempted to target these three Group A candidates with\\n\\nthese optimized slit positions (2020B N168, PI Prichard,\\n\\nweathered out). We were recently re-awarded this time\\n\\nfor January 2022 (2021B N87, PI Prichard).\\n\\nThe remaining Group B and Group C photometric\\n\\ncandidates are relatively faint with isophotal optical\\n\\nmagnitudes (& 26 mag, down to 28.3 mag). Note that\\n\\nthe isophotal magnitudes are a conservative clean flux\\n\\nestimate (best for accurate colors) that may not include\\n\\nall the flux of a source. In good conditions, with seeing\\n\\n< 1′′, we expect to get redshifts in 4–6 hours down to\\n\\nmF814W ∼ 26. If a candidate has a strong line, assumed\\n\\nto be Lyα in emission, a redshift can be determined for\\n\\na source fainter than mF814W ∼ 26.\\n\\nHigh S/N spectroscopy is essential for identifying gen-\\n\\nuine LCGs. In a recent complimentary LCG study\\n\\nwith MOSFIRE, Bassett et al. (2022) found that the\\n\\nZFOURGE photometric redshifts for all seven LCG can-\\n\\ndidates were overestimated by δz ∼ 0.2, most likely due\\n\\nto template mismatch. These candidates were therefore\\n\\nruled out as LCGs as their true spectroscopic redshift\\n\\nplaced them at a redshift such that the U -band was\\n\\nnot cleanly sampling the LyC. Although the ZFOURGE\\n\\nstated accuracy is ∼ 2% errors (Straatman et al. 2016),\\n\\nBassett et al. (2022) concluded that the search for LCGs\\n\\nis biased towards finding overestimated redshifts (with\\n\\n94% confidence). The results of this paper further em-\\n\\nphasize that HST data are required for removing low-\\n\\nredshift interlopers, and demonstrate the requirement of\\n\\nblue spectra to aid with the removal of contaminants.\\n\\nRedder wavelengths can be used to confirm redshifts,\\n\\nbut may miss blue features to aid with contaminant\\n\\nremoval. We have had supporting programs at red-\\n\\nder wavelengths using Keck/MOSFIRE (2018B W151,\\n\\nPI Bassett) that focused on the [OIII]/[OII] relation\\n\\nwith LyC (Bassett et al. 2019, 2022). The combina-\\n\\ntion of MOS observations spanning the bluest wave-\\n\\nlengths does provide the best opportunity for getting\\n\\nredshifts and removing low redshift contaminants effi-\\n\\nciently, along with the opportunity to spectroscopically\\n\\ndetect the LyC in optimal observing conditions if bright\\n\\nenough. Keck/LRIS is not the only blue MOS option\\n\\nwe have tried, we were awarded telescope time with the\\n\\nLarge Binocular Telescope/MODS (LBT) that was also\\n\\nweathered out (see Table 3 for a summary). Integral\\n\\nfield units (IFUs) could be valuable for exploring spec-\\n\\ntroscopic properties of individual LyC emission regions\\n\\nand for removing contaminants. However, this requires\\n\\nhigh pixel resolution (< 1′′) for these small sources and\\n\\nis less efficient for building up statistical samples.\\n\\nAdditional information in the blue part of the spec-\\n\\ntrum can help reveal the nature of the detection and if\\n\\nit is contaminated. This expensive spectroscopic cam-\\n\\npaign will be handled with superior efficiency for galax-\\n\\nies such as our candidates with the new class of blue\\n\\nMOS instruments on 30 m telescopes. Additionally, the\\n\\nproposed Keck Wide-Field Imager (KWFI; Gillingham\\n\\net al. 2020) would provide photometry down to ∼ 29\\n\\nmag in u in just ∼ 5 hours and ∼ 3 hours in g over an\\n\\narea ∼ 150× that of HST to rapidly identify photomet-\\n\\nric candidates for spectroscopic follow-up. This com-\\n\\nbination could efficiently detect and confirm statistical\\n\\nsamples of LCGs that could help to constrain valuable\\n\\ncosmic reionization parameters.\\n\\n7. SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONS\\n\\nWe present new deep WFC3/F336W and\\n\\nACS/F435W HST images (with depths ∼ 29–30 mag\\n\\nat 5σ), that we use to identify a population of high-\\n\\nredshift LCG candidates. We process the WFC3/UVIS\\n\\nimages with our new custom pipeline that reduces noise,\\n\\ngradients, hot pixels and offsets in the images to pro-\\n\\nduce the cleanest HST UV data possible. Some of our\\n\\ncustom reduction steps for WFC3/UVIS have now been\\n\\nadopted by the WFC3 team and are available for down-\\n\\nload directly from MAST for all existing data. We apply\\n\\nadditional corrections to the F336W images that are not\\n\\nincluded on MAST but are easily applied to data with\\n\\na new public reduction notebook13.\\n\\nWe collate a comprehensive Parent Sample of pos-\\n\\nsible candidates without relying on the Lyman-break\\n\\ntechnique. We use photometric redshifts from the\\n\\nZFOURGE survey, COSMOS, CANDELS, and publicly\\n\\navailable spectroscopic redshifts from 16 surveys within\\n\\nour new HST footprints. Although no catalog will be\\n\\nfree from selection bias, this is one of the most com-\\n\\nprehensive and agnostic LCG searches possible with the\\n\\navailable data. There are 3065 objects at all redshifts\\n\\nin the two F336W footprints and 6430 in the three\\n\\nF435W footprints (our All-z Sample). 380 sources are\\n\\nat z > 3.087 in F336W and 242 at z > 4.391 in F435W,\\n\\nthe redshift limits (zlim) for the bands to cleanly probe\\n\\nLyC (Parent Sample).

We\\n\\npresent the spectra obtained for some of our sources\\n\\nwith Keck/LRIS (∼ 1.5 nights). We acquire spectro-\\n\\nscopic redshifts for the three brightest LCG candidates\\n\\n(i.e., Group A spectroscopic candidates): zf 9775 at\\n\\nz = 4.365, zf 11754 at z = 4.470, and zf 14000 at\\n\\nz = 3.727. The list of candidates is cleaned and we se-\\n\\nlect only those with > 3σ LyC detections. The remain-\\n\\ning 32 sources are photometric LCG candidates that we\\n\\nsplit by redshift confidence. Group B has 10 LCG can-\\n\\ndidates with relatively confident photometric (and one\\n\\nlow-quality public spectroscopic) redshift. Group C has\\n\\n22 candidates with more unreliable redshifts. We sum-\\n\\nmarize the main results of this work below.\\n\\n• We find a 6.84% detection rate of our > 3σ LCG\\n\\ncandidates in the F336W footprints and 3.72% in the\\n\\nF435W footprints relative to the Parent Sample. We\\n\\nfind number densities of ∼ 1.8 arcmin−2 at z > 3.087\\n\\nin the F336W pointings and ∼ 0.1–0.4 arcmin−2 at\\n\\nz > 4.391 in the F435W pointings (at varying depths).\\n\\n• We determine conservative redshift-independent LyC\\n\\ncontamination probabilities of 1.8%–3.3% depending\\n\\non the field. These are higher than the LCG candidate\\n\\nto All-z Sample detection rates (0.85% for F336W,\\n\\n0.14% for F435W). Most of the candidates are in\\n\\nGroup C, whose redshifts we are least confident in\\n\\nand that are likely to be dominated by low-redshift\\n\\ninterlopers.\\n\\n• The HST images and Keck/LRIS spectroscopy for the\\n\\nthree Group A spectroscopic candidates imply that\\n\\nthese detections could be genuine. We determine fesc\\nusing the traditional (fabsesc ) and a statistical (fPDF\\n\\nesc )\\n\\napproach. The results imply that the most likely es-\\n\\ncape fraction estimates for all three spectroscopic can-\\n\\ndidates for both methods is > 100%, and therefore not\\n\\nphysical given the models and assumptions used.\\n\\n• From the purely illustrative color-color plots, most\\n\\ncandidates sit outside of the LBG box. They lie\\n\\non tracks with observed LyC to UV continuum flux\\n\\nratios (Robs). Calculated directly from their LyC\\n\\n(F336W or F435W) to UV continuum (F814W) bands\\n\\nare Robs = 4%, 3% and 9% for zf 9775, zf 11754 and\\n\\nzf 14000 respectively. This could imply that the LCG\\n\\ncandidates are similar to LBG galaxies with LyC emis-\\n\\nsion, or that they have flux contamination.\\n\\n• The three Group A spectroscopic LCG candidates and\\n\\n32 Group B and C photometric LCG candidates re-\\n\\nquire spectroscopic follow up to confirm their true\\n\\nnature. Even with spectroscopic redshifts, UV-HST\\n\\nimaging and multi-band photometry, more informa-\\n\\ntion is required to confirm these as genuine LCGs.\\n\\nThe future KWFI instrument will be valuable for ef-\\n\\nficiently identifying new faint LCG candidates. The\\n\\nnew class of 30 m telescopes will be able to spectro-\\n\\nscopically confirm the faintest candidates presented\\n\\nhere so that larger statistical samples can be built up\\n\\nfor constraining cosmic reionization parameters.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\n\\nWe thank the anonymous reviewer for a helpful re-\\n\\nport.

WFC3/UVIS DARKS PIPELINE IMPROVEMENTS\\n\\nWe make several improvements to the WFC3/UVIS reduction pipeline (Bourque & Baggett 2016) for which we\\n\\nprovide details here. The WFC3/UVIS channel has a charge coupled device (CCD) detector. Photons landing on the\\n\\narray are converted to charge which is measured by being transferred across the array to the “readout” amplifiers. Due\\n\\nto degradation of the detector over time from radiation, charge traps develop, reducing the charge transfer efficiency\\n\\n(CTE). This effect is corrected after the fact (e.g., Anderson 2020; Anderson et al. 2021) to recover as much of the\\n\\noriginal flux as possible.\\n\\nThe detector also has imperfections such as hot pixels. The WFC3/UVIS CCD undergoes anneals (brief heating\\n\\nof the detector every ∼month) to reduce the number of hot pixels. In each anneal cycle (period between anneals),\\n\\nthe detector has a different “fingerprint”. Darks and data are typically processed as soon as possible after being\\n\\nobserved. This speed means that darks from the previous anneal cycle (using a different detector fingerprint than the\\n\\nobservations) are used to calibrate the data which diminishes the quality of the previously available data products.\\n\\nThe new CTE code (calwf3 v3.6.0; Anderson 2020; Anderson et al. 2021) optimizes parameters for the data to\\n\\nmitigate read noise, which reduces background noise and gradients across the images. Figure A1 (top left panel) shows\\n\\nthe RMS measured in 1000 randomly placed apertures on sky (avoiding sources) of a drizzled image processed with\\n\\nthe old CTE code (red) and the new code (blue). The background noise is significantly reduced with the new code.\\n\\nThe CTE corrections are applied to both the science data and the darks in the reduction. Figure A1 (top right panel)\\n\\nshows the signal gradients across one chip of a single FLC. We show the median signal of each row (dots) and the\\n\\nrunning median of the row values (lines) for the old (red) and new (blue) CTE code. The new CTE correction results\\n\\nin much flatter signal across the chips. The new CTE code along with the use of concurrent darks (from the same\\n\\nanneal cycle as the data are observed) are now included as standard by WFC3, and are available from MAST (as of\\n\\nMay 2021).\\n\\nWe developed a novel flagging routine to identify hot pixels more effectively. The method used by MAST adopts\\n\\na constant threshold, and due to the imperfect CTE correction, increasingly more hot pixels are missed further from\\n\\nthe readout. To correct for this loss of hot pixels caused by CTE degradation, we derive a variable threshold for every\\n\\nchip to identify roughly a constant number of hot pixels across the chip as expected. The most accurate number of\\n\\nhot pixels is closest to the readout with the shortest distance to travel across the array. We therefore take this value\\n\\nto be the true number of hot pixels, and find the threshold that selects just below this value for each set of 50 rows.\\n\\nWe then fit a function to those values to derive a variable threshold conversion for each chip.\\n\\nFigure A1 (bottom panel) shows the number of hot pixels as a function of row number with the readout locations at\\n\\nthe edges of the plot. We show the hot pixels identified using a constant threshold (red) and the new variable threshold\\n\\nmethod (blue) for the old (faint lines) and new CTE code (bold lines). The new CTE code increases the number of\\n\\nhot pixels missed as the flux pedestal subtracted is larger, so more pixels are below the previous constant threshold.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/robbassett\\nhttps://github.com/lprichard\\nhttps://github.com/mrevalski\\nhttps://github.com/bsunnquist/uvis-skydarks\\n\\n\\n30 L. J. Prichard et al.\\n\\nFigure A1. Top left: Comparison of RMS measured from images processed with the old CTE code (red) vs. the new CTE\\ncode (blue). The RMS of the background is measured from 1000 random apertures on sky (avoiding sources). The new CTE\\ncode significantly reduces the background with an average of 3.3 × 10−4 e/s from 3.9 × 10−4 e/s, valuable for the detection\\nof faint sources. Top right: Signal gradients across one chip of an individual FLC. The median of each row (points) and the\\nrunning medians (solid lines) are shown for the old (red) and new (blue) CTE codes. The new CTE reduces the gradients over\\nthe chips. Bottom: Number of hot pixels identified as a function of row number across chip 2 (left) and chip 1 (right). The\\nprevious method using a constant threshold (red lines) misses ∼30% of hot pixels. Using a new variable threshold (blue lines)\\nidentifies the correct number of hot pixels across each entire chip. Bold and faint lines show the new and old CTE corrections\\nrespectively.\\n\\nThe constant threshold misses around ∼ 30% of the expected hot pixels. For a detailed step-by-step run through of\\n\\nall the steps we use for the WFC3/UVIS reduction, see our pipeline and supplementary codes on GitHub14.\\n\\nWe flag negative divots adjacent to the readout cosmic rays (ROCRs) in the FLC data quality (DQ) arrays to\\n\\nprevent them from propagating through to the drizzled images. As these cosmic rays appear during readout, they fall\\n\\ncloser to the amplifier than they appear in the FLCs, which causes over-corrections by the CTE code. Due to their\\n\\nnature, these flags increase with distance from the amplifier while the array is being readout, and affect a total of\\n\\n14 https://github.com/lprichard/hst wfc3 uvis reduction\\n\\nhttps://github.com/lprichard/hst_wfc3_uvis_reduction\\n\\n\\nLCG Candidates in COSMOS 31\\n\\nFigure A2. Comparison of a reduced CTE-corrected single-visit exposure (FLC) using the old and new reduction methods.\\nAn FLC previously available on MAST is shown on the left. On the right is an FLC reduced with the new darks (including the\\nnew hot pixel method) and new CTE (that reduces noise and gradients). An additional correction to equalize the bias offsets\\nbetween the four quadrants is also applied (medsub).\\n\\n∼ 0.2% detector pixels. We flag divots within five pixels of a CR hit (away from the readout direction) that are 3σ\\n\\nbelow the image mean as bad detector pixels (value of 4 in the DQ arrays).\\n\\nWe equalize the overall signal levels in the four amplifier quadrants of each FLC. Typically, small bias offsets\\n\\nexceeding one electron can exist between these regions, causing discontinuities in the background. To remove these\\n\\ndifferences, we calculate the offsets between the median level in each individual quadrant and the average of all four\\n\\nquadrants, multiply the difference by the flat field, and subtract these offsets from the original data. As the zeropoints\\n\\nare determined as an average over all four quadrants, the equalization of the amps does not affect our photometry as\\n\\nwe have a roughly even distribution of sources in the images.\\n\\nFigure A2 shows a comparison of an FLC previously available on MAST (left) and one processed using the new\\n\\nconcurrent darks, the new CTE, and the amplifier bias offsets equalized (medsub). Gradients, noise, offsets, and blotchy\\n\\npatterns are greatly reduced using the new reduction methods.

We highlight two potentially real spectral features in red. However, as the\\n\\nspectrum is noisy and is shown heavily smoothed here, we are not confident of the DM18 redshift. This galaxy\\n\\ntherefore remains in Group B with the same confidence as our photometric candidates. Both spectra have assigned\\n\\nquality flags from DM18 of 1 (lowest quality), and a quality flag in the combined spectroscopic catalog of 2 (from 1\\n\\nuncertain to 4 best) based on a comparison of available redshifts in each of the 16 catalogs.\\n\\n15 https://github.com/lprichard/HST FLC corrections\\n\\nhttps://github.com/lprichard/HST_FLC_corrections\\n\\n\\n32 L.

Top: DM18 spectrum of a Group A spectroscopic candidate, zf 14000 (DM18 ID:\\nL677152). The redshift we determine from the LRIS spectrum (Figure 3) is z = 3.727. We show the DM18 spectrum shifted to\\nthe redshift from LRIS (green) and the spectrum at the DM18 redshift of zDM18 = 3.779 (black) for comparison.

The\\n3D-HST spectrum does not provide sufficient evidence for either redshift, we therefore deem the 3D-HST redshift invalid due\\nto the confident redshift we derive from the LRIS spectrum (Figure 3).\\n\\nWe show the unsmoothed 3D-HST G141 grism spectrum (Brammer et al. 2012; Momcheva et al. 2016) of the Group\\n\\nA spectroscopic candidate zf 9775 in Figure B2. The same spectrum is shown at rest wavelengths assuming the redshift\\n\\nderived from our LRIS spectrum (zLRIS = 4.365, green, top panel) and that quoted in 3D-HST (z3DHST = 0.446, black,\\n\\nbottom panel). There are no redshift quality flags provided by the 3D-HST survey. However, as the zf 9775 3D-HST\\n\\nredshift is derived from a single < 1σ S III line, it is low confidence. The 3D-HST grism spectra are not visually\\ninspected. A recent paper performed visual inspection of a large number of 3D-HST spectra and found that a quarter\\n\\nof the published redshifts are not correct (Henry et al. 2021). Additionally, redshifts for zf 9775 from ZFOURGE,\\n\\nCOSMOS, average CANDELS, and LRIS are all in close agreement with a stated redshift of z ∼ 4.2–4.4. The 3D-HST\\n\\nredshift (z = 0.446) deviates from these values significantly.\\n\\nC. ESCAPE FRACTION SIMULATIONS\\n\\nWe summarize the key steps for estimating fesc PDFs for the three Group A spectroscopic LCG candidates. This\\n\\nmethod is detailed in full in Bassett et al. (2022). See Section 5.4 for a summary of the results.\\n\\n1. We use a range of possible SED templates from BPASS (v2.1; Eldridge et al. 2017). We combine these with a single,\\n\\nexponentially declining SFH with e-folding time 0.1 Gyr. We also use BPASS models with metallicity Z∗ = 0.001–\\n\\n0.020 (as in Steidel et al. 2018; Fletcher et al. 2019; Bassett et al. 2021a), initial mass function slope α = −2.35,\\n\\nand stellar-mass limit 300 M�. We consider only SED models with ages . 2.5× 108 years ((L900/L1500)int > 0.05)\\n\\nas fainter LyC is highly unlikely to be detected in galaxies at z \\' 3.7–4.4.\\n\\n2. We estimate E(B−V) at each BPASS model age. We apply each E(B−V) value to a Reddy et al. (2016) attenuation\\n\\ncurve, determine photometric fluxes of attenuated models using the ZFOURGE filters and minimize χ2. With the\\n\\noptimal E(B−V) for a given age, we calculate the likelihood that the model represents our LCG candidates. This\\n\\n\\n\\n34 L. J. Prichard et al.\\n\\nFigure C1. Log(probability) for zf 11754 at each age and metallicity of the BPASS models (top panel). The LCG candi-\\ndate strongly prefers a young, metal-poor template. These grids are used to determine the best E(B-V) to the ZFOURGE\\nphotometry for exponentially declining star-formation rate (SFR) BPASS models at a range of metallicities and ages. For\\nboth zf 11754, zf 9775 and zf 14000 the best E(B-V) is always 0. The lower two panels show the intrinsic L(900)/L(1500) and\\nL(F435W)/L(F814W) ratios for every single model age and metallicity.\\n\\nproduces a best matched model (age, metallicity, and E(B−V)) for our photometry which we use for calculating\\n\\nthe fesc PDFs.\\n\\n3. We measure the log(probability) of each LCG candidate for every age and metallicity of the BPASS models in our\\n\\nrange. We also measure the intrinsic LyC to non-ionizing UV continuum luminosity ratio (L900/L1500)int and the\\n\\nmeasured (LLyC/LF814W) where LLyC is either F336W or F435W depending on the LCG candidate. The resulting\\n\\nweights for zf 11754 are shown in Figure C1. The best fitting models for all three Group A candidates is “zero-age”\\n\\nfor BPASS which is equivalent to a single, instantaneous burst with an age of 106 years (i.e., only one template is\\n\\nused). For these zero-age best-fit models, the choice of SFH will not change the fact that the result is unconstrained\\n\\n(i.e., still > 100%, see Section 5.4). An investigation into the difference of model SFH for the probabilistic fPDF\\nesc\\n\\nmethod is therefore not appropriate for these candidates and is beyond the scope of this paper.\\n\\n4. To generate an fesc PDF, for each SED model we need to sample the PDF of IGM transmission TIGM. 10,000\\n\\nIGM sight lines are produced using the taoist-mc code16 (described in full in Bassett et al. 2021a), based on\\n\\nmethods from Inoue et al. (2014); Steidel et al. (2018). These are produced for each redshift of the Group A\\n\\nspectroscopic candidates. Given their relatively close redshifts, these have very similar distributions and we show\\n\\n16 https://github.com/robbassett/TAOIST MC\\n\\nhttps://github.com/robbassett/TAOIST_MC\\n\\n\\nLCG Candidates in COSMOS 35\\n\\nFigure C2. IGM transmission curves for zf 11754 (z = 4.470), the highest redshift spectroscopic LCG candidate in Group A.\\nShown is the median (black line) of the 10,000 IGM curves generated. The 5th (red), 25th (orange), 75th (yellow), and 95th\\n\\n(green) percentiles are also shown. The Lyman break (∼ 912 Å) is shown (red dashed line). Overlaid is the LyC probing filter\\nfor this candidate F435W (turquoise). The curves generated for all three of the Group A spectroscopic candidates are very\\nsimilar due to their close redshifts. The median and percentile IGM curves do not represent individual lines of sight.\\n\\njust one distribution for zf 11754 in Figure C2. The median and percentile IGM curves do not represent individual\\n\\nsight lines.\\n\\n5. We then determine the probability that the photometric LyC flux and error is consistent with fesc considering the\\n\\nSED models and IGM transmission curves. We apply our ensemble of 10,000 IGM curves and 10,000 fesc values\\n\\n(between 0 and 1) to every BPASS model. We measure the probability (Pobs) that a given mock observation is\\n\\nconsistent with the observations. We take the value at a model flux for a Gaussian distribution with center of the\\n\\nobserved flux and FWHM of the error.\\n\\n6. The probability of any fesc value is taken as the median across all 10,000 sight lines. The PDFs of fesc are for an\\n\\nindividual SED age, metallicity, and E(B−V). We therefore use our best fitting models from Step 2 to generate the\\n\\nmost appropriate fesc PDF (and corresponding fPDF\\nesc estimate) for each of our sources.\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n\\nAihara, H., AlSayyad, Y., Ando, M., et al. 2019, PASJ, 71,\\n\\n114, doi: 10.1093/pasj/psz103\\n\\nAlavi, A., Siana, B., Richard, J., et al. 2014, ApJ, 780, 143,\\n\\ndoi: 10.1088/0004-637X/780/2/143\\n\\n—. 2016, ApJ, 832, 56, doi: 10.3847/0004-637X/832/1/56\\n\\nAlavi, A., Colbert, J., Teplitz, H.
